LOS ANGELES 2029 A. D.
THE MACHlNES ROSE FROM THE ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FlRE.
BUT THE FlNAL BATTLE WOULD NOT BE FOUGHT lN THE FUTURE.
lT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE, lN OUR PRESENT.
TONlGHT...
LOS ANGELES 1984 1: 52a. m.
What the hell...?
Goddamn son- of- a- bitch...
What the hell...?
Hey, my turn.
Hey, what' s wrong with this picture?
Nice night for a walk?
Nice night for a walk.
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?
Right.
I think this guy' s a couple of cans short of a six- pack.
Your clothes, give them to me.
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.
Hey, buddy, did you just see a real bright light?
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.
I said hold it!
That son- of- a- bitch took my pants.
The date.
- 1 2th May.
- Thursday.
- What year?
He' s got my gun.
Let' s go.
Guard it for me, Big Buns.
Hi.
I' m late.
So am l.
- So am l.
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.
Who gets the burly- beef?
- I ordered barbecued.
That' s mine, but I didn' t order fries.
- Mine' s the chilli beef deluxe.
- Who gets the burly- beef?
- We' re ready to order now.
- Yes, ma' am.
I' m so sorry.
This isn' t real leather, is it?
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.
ln 100 years, who' s gonna care?
The 1 2- gauge auto- loader.
That' s ltalian.
You can go pump or auto.
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.
We just got them in.
That' s a good gun.
The beam comes on - you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go.
You can' t miss.
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40- watt range.
Hey, just what you see, pal.
The Uzi nine millimetre.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Any one of these is ideal for home defence.
So which will it be?
- All.
- I may close early today.
It' s a 1 5- day wait on the handguns, but the rifles you can take now.
- You can' t do that.
- Wrong.
Yeah, yeah, it' s me.
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.
I don' t care what you' re doing.
Come and get me.
What the...?
Hey, man, you got a serious attitude problem.
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?
I' m on my break, Chuck.
Carla' s got my station.
Sarah, come here.
It' s about you.
I mean, sort of.
You' re not gonna believe this.
You' re going to love this.
- What? -.. compiled from several witnesses.
Once again, Sarah Connor, 35, mother oftwo, brutally shot to death this afternoon.
You' re dead, honey.
Sorry.
Hello?
First I' m gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one, then run my tongue down your neck to your bare, gleaming breasts.
And then slowly... slowly pull yourjeans offinch by inch.
Ginger, it' s Matt.
And lick your belly in circles further and further down, and then pull your panties off with my teeth.
Who is this?
God.
Sarah?
Jesus.
I' m sorry.
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?
Sure.
It' s the creep.
Hello?
First I' il rip the buttons off your blouse one by one...
You fucking pigs.
Wait till I get my hands on you.
Get off me.
Ed.
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.
You know, these work.
- What' s this?
- Dead girl two.
Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon.
Are you sure there' s a point to all of this?
Look at the name, Ed.
Sarah Louise Connor. ls this right?
You' re kidding.
The press is gonna be short- stroking it.
- A one- day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.
So...
Better than mortal man deserves.
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately.
Did you check messages?
I thought you did.
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.
You mind your mother.
Hi, Sarah.
Stan Morsky.
Something' s come up.
Just can' t get out ofit.
I' m really sorry.
I' il make it up to you.
Bye.
That bum.
So what if he has a Porsche?
He can' t treat you like this.
It' s Friday night, for Christ' s sake.
I' il live.
I' il break his kneecaps.
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don' t you, baby?
God.
It' s disgusting.
I' m gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.
- We will.
You, too.
- OK.
Damn it, Matt.
Shit.
These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book.
No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...
That coffee' s two hours cold.
I put a cigarette out in it.
- No.
I got her answering machine.
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit.
There' s no answer.
- The apartment manager' s not in.
- Call her.
- I just called her.
- Call her again.
Give me a cigarette.
Hi, there.
Fooled you.
You' re talking to a machine.
It' s OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...
Same shit.
He' s gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
Especially the weird press cases.
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.
Maybe make these jackals work for us.
lf I can get on the tube by eleven o' clock, maybe she' il call us.
Well, how do I look?
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.
Police have announced the name ofthe victim in the second oftwo murders which took place today.
lncredibly, the names ofthe two victims are virtually identical.
Two hours ago, 35- year- old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead...
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise...
Don' t touch it.
Police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet.
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It' s in the back.
Four- fifty.
You have reached the Los Angeles Police emergency number.
All lines are busy. lfyou need a police car sent out to you, stay on the line.
Go on.
I' m gonna make a belt out of you.
Don' t make me bust you up, man.
Hi, there.
Fooled you.
You' re talking to a machine.
It' s OK.
Machines need love, too.
So talk to it and Ginger, that' s me, or Sarah will get back to you.
Wait for the beep.
This is Sarah.
Pick up ifyou' re there.
I' m at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir.
I' m really scared.
I hope that you play this back soon.
I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible.
I' m gonna give 'em another try.
The number here is 555 9175.
I need your help.
It' s her.
Sarah Connor?
It' s Lieutenant Traxler.
Don' t transfer me to another department.
I won' t.
Can you tell me where you are?
- I' m in this bar called Tech Noir.
It' s on Pico.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don' t wanna leave.
- I think there' s a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.
You' re in a public place so you' il be safe.
Don' t go outside.
- I' il have a car there in a minute.
Hey, that guy didn' t pay.
Come with me if you wanna live.
Come on!
This is one- L- 19.
I got a hit- and- run felony.
Suspect vehicle - late model grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.
I' m gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now.
Hold it.
Hold on.
Are you injured?
Are you shot?
Do exactly what I say.
Exactly.
Don' t move unless I say.
Don' t make a sound unless I say.
Do you understand?
- Do you understand?
Please don' t hurt me.
I' m here to help you.
I' m Reese.
Sergeant Tech- Com.
DN38416.
Assigned to protect you.
You' ve been targeted for termination.
This is one- L- 19.
Approaching Overland.
This is a mistake.
I didn' t do anything.
No, but you will.
It' s very important that you live.
This isn' t true.
How could that man just get up after you...
It' s not a man.
A machine.
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.
A machine?
Like a robot?
Not a robot.
A cyborg - cybernetic organism.
- No.
- Just a second.
Get your head down.
Listen.
Part man, part machine.
Underneath it' s a hyper- alloy combat chassis.
Microprocessor controlled.
Outside it' s living human tissue.
Flesh, skin, hair, blood - grown for the cyborgs.
- Look, Reese, I don' t know...
- Pay attention.
I gotta ditch this car.
The 600- Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.
But these are new.
They look human.
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.
I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.
Not yet.
Not for about forty years.
Are you saying it' s from the future?
One possible future... from your point of view.
I don' t know tech stuff.
ls that right?
- Right.
- Right.
Cyborgs don' t feel pain.
I do.
Don' t do that again.
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.
That Terminator is out there.
It can' t be bargained with, it can' t be reasoned with.
It doesn' t feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.
Can you stop it?
I don' t know.
With these weapons, I don' t know.
Ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure...
Reese, why me?
Why does it want me?
There was a nuclear war.
A few years from now, all this, this whole place, everything, it' s gone, just gone.
There were survivors.
Here, there.
Nobody even knew who started it.
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don' t understand.
Defence network computers.
New, powerful, hooked into everything, trusted to run it all.
They say it got smart - a new order of intelligence.
Not just the ones on the other side.
It decided our fate in a microsecond.
Extermination.
Did you see this war?
No.
I grew up after. ln the ruins.
Starving.
Hiding from the H- Ks.
- H- Ks?
- Hunter- killers.
Patrol machines built in automated factories.
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.
This was burned in by laser scanner.
Some of us were kept alive.
To work.
Loading bodies.
The disposal units ran night and day.
We were that close to going out for ever.
But there was one man who taught us to fight.
To storm the wire of the camps.
To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk.
He brought us back from the brink.
His name was Connor.
John Connor.
Your son, Sarah.
Your unborn son.
Drive.
Reese!
No, Reese.
No, no, no.
They' il kill you.
You in the Cadillac, let me see your hands now.
Get out of the car.
Drop to your knees.
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.
Sarah.
Sarah, try to drink some of this.
Listen, are you sure it' s them?
I mean, maybe I should look at the bodies.
They' ve been identified and there' s no doubt.
Kiddo.
- Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.
Tell him everything Reese told you, Sarah.
Do you feel up to that?
Yeah, I guess so.
- You' re a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.
- ls Reese crazy?
- That' s what we' re gonna find out.
So you' re a soldier.
Fighting for whom?
With the 1 32nd under Perry.
From '21 to' 27.
That' s the year 2027?
That' s right.
Then I was assigned...
- This is fucking great. -.. under John Connor.
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system...
Goddamn!
Sorry... built for SAC- NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems.
I see.
And this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy.
Killing him, in effect, before he' s even conceived.
A sort of retroactive abortion?
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.
Why didn' t the computer just kill Connor then?
Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.
We' d won.
Taking out Connor then would make no difference.
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.
What is it called?
The time displacement equipment?
That' s right.
The Terminator had already gone through.
Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place.
Well, how are you supposed to get back?
I can' t.
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It' s just him and me.
It' s just him and me.
Something more advanced.
Don' t you have ray guns?
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.
You go naked.
Something about the field generated by a living organism.
Nothing dead will go.
I didn' t build the fucking thing.
OK, OK.
But this cyborg, ifit' s metal...?
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.
Great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.
See how clever it is?
It doesn' t require a shred of proof.
Most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant.
- Why were the other women killed?
- Records were lost in the war.
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor' s mother.
Her full name, where she lived.
Theyjust knew the city.
The Terminator was just being systematic.
- Let' s go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.
I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.
- I' m afraid that' s not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...
Shut up!
You still don' t get it, do you?
He' il find her.
That' s what he does.
That' s all he does.
You can' t stop him.
He' il reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out!
- Doc.
- Let go ofme!
Sorry.
He' s crazy?
ln technical terminology, he' s a loon.
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.
It' il stop a 1 2- gauge round.
This other man must' ve been wearing one under his coat.
Feel that.
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn' t feel it.
You see this scar?
Thank you.
There' s a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.
Be at least an hour before your mother gets here.
- I can' t sleep.
- Try.
It may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.
You' il be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.
Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I' m a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she' s here.
Could I see her?
Can' t see her.
She' s making a statement.
Where is she?
It make take a while. lf you wanna wait, there' s a bench over there.
I' il be back.
Stay here.
Watch him.
Ed...
Sarah!
Reese.
This way.
KFLB news time.
4. 36.
Top story - the largest single law enforcement mobilisation in California history is currently underway.
Take this.
All right.
Let' s get this off the road.
- You cold?
- Freezing.
Reese?
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.
Kyle, what' s it like when you go through time?
White light.
Pain.
- It' s like being born maybe.
- My God.
I caught one back there.
- You mean you got shot?
- It' s not bad.
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
Forget it.
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy?
Take this off.
Jesus.
It passed right through the meat.
This is gonna make me puke.
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?
I don' t know.
Anything.
Just talk.
Tell me about my son.
He' s about my height.
He has your eyes.
What' s he like?
You trust him.
He' s got a strength.
I' d die for John Connor.
Well, at least now I know what to name him.
Don' t suppose you know who the father is so I won' t tell him to get lost?
John never said much about him.
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.
I don' t wanna know.
So was it John that sent you here?
I volunteered.
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.
Sarah Connor, who taught her son to fight, organise, prepare from when he was a kid.
When you were in hiding before the war.
You' re talking about things I haven' t done yet in the past tense.
It' s driving me crazy.
Are you sure you have the right person?
I' m sure.
Do I look like the mother of the future?
Organised?
I can' t even balance my chequebook.
Look, Reese, I didn' t ask for this honour and I don' t want it.
Any of it.
Your son gave me a message to give to you.
Made me memorise it.
Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.
I can' t help you with what you must soon face.
The future is not set.
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.
You must survive or I will never exist.
That' s all.
It' s a good field dressing.
You like it?
It' s my first.
Get some sleep.
It' il be light soon.
OK.
Talk to me some more.
About what?
Tell me about where you' re from.
All right.
You stay down by day, but at night you can move around.
You still have to be careful because the H- Ks use infrared.
John taught us ways to dust them.
That' s when the infiltrators started to appear.
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.
Let' s go.
- Reese.
DN384...
Let him in.
Terminator!
I was dreaming about dogs.
We use 'em to spot Terminators.
Your world is pretty terrifying.
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what?
Fuck you, asshole.
God damn.
Thank you.
ls this enough?
Yeah, it' s enough.
I don' t wanna ask where you got it.
- I' m coming.
- We need a room.
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?
I am dying for a shower.
We should check your bandage, too.
Later.
I' m going out for supplies.
Keep this.
No, I can' t tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.
You tell me to hide out at the cabin and you won' t tell me what' s going on?
I am worried sick here.
OK.
OK, here' s the number.
- You ready?
Go ahead.
It' s 408 555 1439.
Room nine.
- I' ve got it.
I' m sorry I can' t tell you more right now.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetheart.
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.
What have we got?
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.
What' s for dinner?
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.
What is it?
It' s a bit more stable.
I learned to make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there' s none on the threads.
Like this.
Screw the end cap on.
Very gently.
You must' ve had a fun childhood.
That' s good.
Six more like that and I' il get started on the fuses.
He' il find us, won' t he?
Probably.
It' il never be over, will it?
I' m shaking.
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.
No, I' m not.
Kyle, the women in your time, what are they like?
Good fighters.
That' s not what I meant.
Was there someone special?
Someone...?
A girl, you know.
No.
Never.
Never?
I' m sorry.
I' m so sorry.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.
So you feel nothing?
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.
I didn' t know why at the time.
It was very old, torn, faded.
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.
I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment.
I memorised every line, every curve.
I came across time for you, Sarah.
I love you.
I always have.
I shouldn' t have said that.
Think fast.
Trade places.
Faster.
Drive faster.
Kyle.
Oh, my God.
You stay here.
Let' s get outta here.
Get out.
Kyle.
Get up.
Come on.
Help me.
Get out.
Get out.
Don' t stop.
Run.
Sarah.
Kyle.
We got him.
No.
Wait.
What are you doing?
Cover, so he can' t track us.
Kyle.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Leave me here.
Move it, Reese.
On your feet, soldier.
On your feet.
Move it.
Get back.
Go back.
- Run, Sarah.
- No.
Run.
Run.
Come on, motherfucker.
No.
You' re terminated, fucker.
Kyle.
Seven.
November 10.
Where was l?
What' s difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.
But I guess I have a while before you' re old enough to understand these tapes.
They' re more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight.
Fill her up.
Should I tell you about your father?
Boy, that' s a tough one.
Will it effect your decision to send him here, knowing that he is your father?
lf you don' t send Kyle, you can never be.
God, a person could go crazy thinking about this.
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.
Maybe it' il help if... you know that in the few hours that we had together, we loved a lifetime' s worth.
- What did he just say?
- He says you' re very beautiful.
He is ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture.
But if he doesn' t, his father will beat him.
Pretty good hustle, kid.
What did he just say?
He said there' s a storm coming in.
I know.
Rod, do they have nude beaches in Florida?
Where are my magazines?
Leslie!
Fifteen and a half sunblock.
Fifteen and a half sunblock.
Could I get a string bikini in Florida?
BUZZ:
Nobody can order pizza in this house.
Where are my golf balls?
You know why?
TRACY:
Has anybody seen my sunblock?
What' s the point of going to Florida... if you' re gonna put on sunblock?
I don' t care if I age like an old suitcase.
- I' m getting toasted.
- Great.
Now you can be a skag with slightly darker skin.
He' s jealous' cause he can' t tan.
FRANK:
Hey, easy on the fluids, pal.
The rubber sheets are packed.
Vicky goes with Ding.
Behind Ding is 200 points.
All right.
Good for you.
Two hundred points.
All right.
KEVlN:
Yes.
Yes.
Everything I put out for you?
Yes.
Yes.
You see what Grandma Penelope sent you for the trip?
Uh, let me guess.
Donald Duck slippers?
Ah ha!
An inflatable clown to play with in the pool.
How exciting.
Why are we going to Florida?
There' s no Christmas trees there.
What is it with you and Christmas trees?
How can we have Christmas without a Christmas tree?
We' il find a nice, fake silver one... or decorate a palm tree.
Good- bye, everybody.
New York' s most exciting hotel experience.
For reservations, call toll free -- 1- 800...
Know where the battery for this camcorder is?
[Beeping]
How' s this?
Oh, much better.
Kevin, you better put your tie on.
We don' t want to be late for the Christmas pageant.
My tie' s in the bathroom.
I can' t go in there.
Uncle Frank' s taking a shower.
He says if I saw him naked...
I' d grow up never feeling like a real man.
I' m sure he was kidding.
Ooh
When I see my Christmas tree
KATE:
Kevin' s solo' s coming up.
PETER:
Kevin' s solo' s coming up.
FRANK:
Huh?
Kevin!
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
I' d like to apologize to my family... for whatever displeasure I might have caused you.
My prank was immature and ill- timed.
FRANK: lmmature or not... it was pretty gol- dern hilarious.
I' d also like to apologize to my brother.
KATE:
Oh, Buzz, that was very nice.
Kevin, do you have something to say?
Beat that, you little trout sniffer.
I' m not sorry!
Buzz humiliated me.
He gets away with everything, so I let him have it.
And since you' re so stupid to believe him...
I don' t care if your idiotic Florida trip gets wrecked.
Who wants to spend Christmas in a tropical climate anyway?
Kevin!
Yeah, with me.
FRANK:
You' d better not wreck my trip, you little sourpuss.
Your dad' s paying good money for it.
I wouldn' t want to spoil your fun, Mr. Cheapskate.
What a troubled young man.
They' re all a bunch of jerks.
Hi.
Last time we tried to take a trip... we had a problem that started just like this.
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.
I don' t care for your choice of words.
That' s not what happened last time or this time.
Buzz apologized to you.
Yeah, then he called me a trout sniffer.
He didn' t mean what he said.
He was just sucking up to you.
OK.
Sit here for a while and think things over.
When you' re ready to apologize to Buzz and everyone else... you can come down.
I' m not apologizing to Buzz.
I' d rather kiss a toilet seat.
Then you can stay here the rest of the night.
Fine.
I don' t wanna be down there.
I can' t trust anybody in this family.
If I had my own money...
I' d go on my own vacation, alone, without any of you guys.
I' d have the most fun in my life.
You got your wish last year.
Maybe you' il get it again.
[Doorbell rings]
We did it again!
Aah!
Our McCallisters in the first van... the other McCallisters in the second van.
I know I shouldn' t complain... but you guys give the worst wake- up calls.
Do you have the tickets?
I' ve got them.
Here' s your family' s.
How many do you have?
- Seven.
- Seven?
- Fourteen.
KATE:
MEGAN:
How come we aren' t sitting together?
We' re lucky to get on the same plane.
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...
Where' s Kevin?
Fourteen.
It' s a good thing I have my own ticket... in case you guys try to ditch me.
Come on, Kevin.
Dad, I need batteries.
They' re in my bag.
Wait till we' re on the plane.
Why can' t I get them now?
PETER:
What' s the gate number?
Eight- seventeen, sir.
It' s the last gate.
Eight- seventeen, Buzz!
Come on, Kevin.
Kevin, you going to take my bag?
You going to take my bag?
Come on.
Watch it, watch it, watch it.
American Airlines flight 226 to New York... is now in the final boarding process.
Come on, come on.
Dad, wait up!
Dad, wait up!
Wait!
Look out!
KATE:
Come on, come on!
Dad, wait!
Here we are.
Here.
Everybody here?
All right.
KATE:
Let me just make sure everyone gets on.
Don' t worry.
WOMAN:
Merry Christmas.
Have a nice flight.
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye- bye.
Hey, wait up!
Hey, guys, wait for me!
- Cutting it kind of close.
- Yeah, sorry.
Merry Christmas.
Dad, wait up!
KEVlN:
ATTENDANT:
That' s all right.
Are you on this flight?
Yeah, so is my family.
I don' t want to be left behind.
- Do you have a boarding pass?
- It' s somewhere.
We have to close up.
He dropped his boarding pass.
This plane can' t leave.
This happened to me last year.
KEVlN:
Yeah.
My dad ran in here before I bumped into her.
OK, board him... but make sure he locates his family before you leave him.
KEVlN:
There' s my dad over there.
OK.
Find a seat.
- Have a merry Christmas.
- You, too.
In order for the captain to push back... we need all passengers to be seated... with their seat belts securely fastened.
[Speaking French]
TOM PETTY SlNGlNG:
Oh, baby, it' s Christmas
I didn' t think we were going to make it.
Something wrong?
Honey?
I have that feeling.
We forgot something?
No, I don' t thinkwe did, but I...
I just have that feeling.
Bad memories, that' s all.
We did everything, we brought everything... we have everybody.
KATE:
Yeah.
Yeah, you' re right.
You' re right.
PETER:
KEVlN:
Mom?
Dad?
Uncle Frank?
Buzz?
We' re the last ones off the plane.
Where are those guys?
- Whose is this?
- That' s Brooke' s.
This is Megan' s.
Brooke.
Give this to Kevin.
Give this to Kevin.
- Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.
Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.
Here you go, Kevin.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
Kevin' s not here.
PETER:
What?!
Kevin!
Excuse me, but this is an emergency.
Yes, sir?
What city is that over there?
That' s New York, sir.
Yikes, I did it again.
Something wrong, sir?
I' il be fine.
Oh, no.
My family' s in Florida, and I' m in New York.
My family' s in Florida...
The cold wind is blowin '
What' s the child' s name?
Kevin.
K- E- V- l- N.
When did you see him last?
Curbside check- in?
I saw him at the door.
OFFlCER:
Most people get separated at security checks.
KATE:
I don' t know.
Peter?
We were in a hurry.
We ran all the way to the gate.
When did you notice he was missing?
When we picked up our baggage here.
BOTH:
No.
PETER:
Mmm.
As a matter of fact, this has happened before.
It' s becoming sort of a family travel tradition.
Funnily enough, we never lose our luggage.
PETER:
Yeah, that' s what my wife meant... when she said it' s a family travel tradition.
We' il call Chicago and, uh... notify them of the situation.
The odds are that' s where he is.
Thanks.
[Honk honk]
Watch out, kid!
Yo, where' s your manifest?
Here we are, Marv.
New York City, the land of opportunity.
MARV:
Yeah.
You know what that is?
Fish.
It' s freedom.
It' s freedom, and it' s money.
It' s freedom.
Let' s get out of here before somebody sees us.
And it' s fish.
Yup, one quick score.
We get ourselves a couple of phony passports... we hightail it to some foreign country.
Arizona?
That' s very smart, Marv.
You bust out of jail to rob fourteen cents from Santa Claus?
Every little bit helps.
Besides, now we got our new nickname.
We' re the Sticky Bandits.
Real cute.
- Very cute.
The Plaza Hotel...
New York' s most exciting hotel experience.
MARV:
What' s the matter?
HARRY:
Come on, let' s go!
I think she likes me.
Excuse me.
Where' s the lobby?
Down the hall and to the left.
Wow!
New York' s most exciting hotel experience.
For reservations call toll- free 1- 800- 759- 3000.
I' il do just that.
Howdy- do.
This is Peter McCallister, the father.
I' d like a hotel room, please... with an extra- large bed, a TV... and one of those little refrigerators... you have to open with a key.
Credit card?
You got it.
Plaza hotel reservations.
RECORDlNG:
Howdy- do.
This is Peter McCallister, the father.
I' d like a hotel room, please... with an extra- large bed, a TV... and one of those little refrigerators... you have to open with a key.
Sir, you' il need a major credit card upon check- in.
Credit card?
WOMAN:
Thank you.
CONClERGE:
Yes, two at 8: 00, Henri -- Mr. Yamamoto.
Hold on a second.
I' il call you back, Henri.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Reservation for McCallister?
A reservation for yourself?
Ma' am, my feet are hardly touching the ground.
I' m barely able to look over this counter.
How could I make a hotel reservation?
Think about it -- a kid going into a hotel, making a reservation?
I don' t think so.
I' m confused.
I' m traveling with my dad.
He' s on business.
He' s at a meeting.
I hate meetings... plus I' m not allowed to go in.
I can only sit in the lobby.
That' s boring... so my dad dropped me off here.
He gave me his credit card... and said whoever was checking people in... to let me in the hotel room... so I won' t get into mischief... and, ma' am, sometimes I do get into mischief.
OFFlCER:
Merry Christmas.
No sign of him.
We' il have to be able to get ahold of you.
- You have hotel arrangements?
- Yeah.
Do you have a recent photo of the boy?
I have one in my wallet.
I don' t have my wallet.
My wallet' s in my bag.
Kevin was looking in my bag at the airport.
He was looking for batteries.
Kevin has my wallet.
Did you have credit cards in the wallet?
Credit cards, money.
We' il notify the credit card companies.
If your son has the cards... we can get a location on him when and if he uses them.
I don' t think Kevin even knows how to use a credit card.
Wow!
- Cedric.
- Yes?
Don' t count your tips in public... and find out everything you can about that young fellow.
Front, please.
Enjoy your stay with us.
Don' t forget to remind your dad when he arrives... that he has to come down and sign a couple of things.
Thank you.
You' ve been most helpful.
May I take your bag, sir?
Up here to your left.
You know, Herbert Hoover once stayed here on this floor.
CEDRlC:
No, the, uh, president.
This is one of our finest suites, sir.
This is great!
A huge bed just for me!
Luxurious... and spacious.
How convenient!
Hey!
Did you want me to put the key in the bag... or did you just want to hang on to it?
I' il hang on to it.
Is everything all right, sir?
Is the temperature in the room OK?
It' s OK.
TV' s my life.
Well...
Oh, I' m sorry.
And there' s plenty more where that came from.
Thank you.
MAN ON LEFT:
No.
BOBBY HELMS SlNGlNG:
Yikes!
This is a vacation.
Hold it right there.
It' s me, Johnny.
I knew it was you.
I could smell you getting off the elevator.
Two scoops, sir?
Two?
Make it three.
WOMAN ON TV:
It' s gardenias, Johnny... your favorite.
You was here last night, too, wasn' t you?
I was singin 'at the Blue Monkey last night.
She was not!
She was smooching with your brother.
You was here... and you was smooching with my brother!
WOMAN ON TV:
That' s a dirty, rotten lie, Johnny.
Don' t give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!
Iittle Mo with the gimpy leg...
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff.
I could go on forever, baby.
You got me all wrong.
All right.
I believe you... but my Tommy gun don' t!
Johnny!
You' re the only duck in my pond!
Get down on your knees and tell me you love me.
Baby!
I' m over the moon for ya!
You got to do betterthan that!
If my love was an ocean...
Lindy' d have to take two airplanes to get across it!
Maybe I' m off my hinges, but I believe you.
- That' s why I' il let you go.
I' m going to give you to the count of three... to get your lousy, lying, lowdown... four- flushing carcass out my door!
She' s rat bait.
One... two...
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Three!
[German accent]
Housekeeping.
TAPE OF FRANK SlNGlNG:
Oh!
ANDYWlLLlAMS:
Uncle Rob lives here.
If they' re back from Paris, I' il drop in on them.
Are they there to guide me?
CHlLDREN SlNGlNG:
CHlLDREN SlNGlNG:
Your drawers, sir.
Don' t flash these babies around here!
There could be girls on this floor!
I was very careful, sir.
I understand.
I' m sorry.
You wanted a tip.
That won' t be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.
No tip?
OK.
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!
How do I get to Columbus Circle?
The doorman will be happy to find you a taxi as --
Mr. McCallister!
Uh... excuse me.
Sure.
And how are we this morning?
Fine.
Is my transportation here?
A limousine and a pizza... compliments of the Plaza Hotel.
I do hope your father understands... that last night I was simply checking the room... to make sure everything was in order.
Oh, he was pretty mad.
He was?
He said he didn' t come to New York... to get his naked rear end spied on.
Of course not.
Will he be down... soon?
He already left.
I would have liked... to have offered my personal apology.
If some guy looked at you in the shower... would you ever want to see him again?
I suppose not.
I don' t think you' il see him for the rest of our trip.
I understand.
Bye.
"M, M, M...
"McCallister."
- Morning, Mr. McCallister.
JOHNNY MATHlS SlNGlNG:
Listening once again
Hello?
Hello.
Know any good toy stores?
Yes, sir!
CONClERGE:
Go on!
Get out of here!
Beat it!
Get out of here!
Hey... Marv!
Get over here!
I got to talk to you!
Whoa!
Would you like a scarf?
Forget the scarf, Marv.
We got to talk.
We don' t have the equipment to pull off anything big -- you know, your banks, jewelry stores.
We don' t want goods.
We need cash, and we need it now.
How about, uh... hotels?
Tourists carry lots of cash.
There' s no guarantees.
I got a better idea.
Stores don' t deposit cash on Christmas Eve.
MARV:
Right... right.
What stores make lots of cash Christmas Eve... that nobody' s going to think to rob?
Candy stores.
Nine- year- olds rob candy stores, Marv.
MARV:
That' s brilliant, Harry.
HARRY:
Yep.
There' s nobody dumb enough... to knock off a toy store on Christmas Eve.
Oh, yes, there is.
Here we are, sir...
Duncan' s Toy Chest.
Merry Christmas, Kevin.
This is the greatest accident of my life.
Marv.
Marv!
MARV:
What' s the plan?
We come out of our little houses...
Yeah, then what?
We empty the registers and walk out like we own the joint.
Great plan, Harry!
CASHlER:
Well, now thank you and merry Christmas.
Say hello to the family.
Eh...
You shopping alone?
In New York?
Sir, I' m afraid of my own shadow.
I was just checking.
CASHlER:
Oh, well, thank you.
That' il be $23. 75.
My, my, my!
Where did you get all that money?
CASHlER:
Oh.
Well, that explains it.
CASHlER:
Oh, well, thank you.
Ietting all the kids come into his store... and play with his toys.
Most toy stores prohibit that.
- Oh, is that so?
- Yep.
Well, he loves kids.
As a matter of fact... all the money the store takes in today...
Mr. Duncan is donating it to the Children' s Hospital... and the day after Christmas... we empty all the money in the cash register... and Mr. Duncan just takes it right down to the hospital.
That' s very generous of him.
Well, children bring him a lot of joy... as they do to everyone who appreciates them.
I' m not supposed to spend this money... but I have twenty dollars from shoveling snow... in a jar in our garage... where my older brother can' t find it.
So I' il pay my mother back with that.
You can give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.
Aw... that' s -- that' s very sweet of you.
Eh... you see that tree there?
I' m going to let you select an object from that tree... that you can take home with you.
- Free?
- Oh, yeah.
Eh... may -- may I make a suggestion?
OK.
Take the turtledoves.
I could have two?
Well, two turtledoves.
I' il tell you what you do.
You keep one... and you give the other one to a very special person.
You see... turtledoves are a symbol of friendship and love.
As long as each of you have your turtledove... you' il be friends forever.
I never knew that.
I thought they were just part of a song.
They are... and -- and for that very special reason.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Be sure to bundle up if you go outside.
It' s a little nippy.
Oh, thank you, l -- I' il do that.
Well, where to?
You promised you' d take me to the Central Park Zoo.
Look who it is, Marv.
Come on.
Hey!
Aah!
Come on!
Watch it, man!
Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush.
Two forfive dollars, fourforten.
MARV:
There he is!
All right, kiddo!
- Oh!
MAN:
Yes!
Thank you for your suggestion.
My duty and my pleasure.
You got to help me!
There' s two guys after me!
What' s the matter?
Store wouldn' t take your... stolen credit card?
Let' s see what the police have to say about this.
Get up!
Get up!
Come on!
CONClERGE:
Get back here, you little thief!
Stop that child!
Grab him!
You little sh --
I' ve committed credit card fraud.
Get me security!
We' ve got to stop that delinquent!
Come along, Cedric.
I' ve had enough of this vacation.
I' m going home.
Hold it right there.
This is the concierge, sir!
I knew it was you.
I could smell you getting off the elevator.
You was here last night, too, wasn' t you?
JOHNNY:
You was here... and you was smooching with my brother!
I' m -- I' m afraid you' re mistaken, sir.
Don' t give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!
Iittle Mo with the gimpy leg...
[Gasps]
No!
It' s a lie!
I could go on forever, baby.
I' m terribly sorry, sir... but I' m afraid you' re mistaken.
We' re looking for a young man.
All right.
I believe you... but my Tommy gun don' t!
CONClERGE:
On your knees.
I love you!
You got to do betterthan that!
I love you!
Maybe I' m off my hinges, but I believe you.
That' s why I' m going to let you go.
I' m going to give you to the count of three... to get your lousy, lying, lowdown... four- flushing carcass out my door!
- One.
- Open up the door!
Two.
Three!
JOHNNY: and a happy New Year.
Stay in your rooms!
This is an emergency!
KEVlN:
MARV:
Ha!
What' s the matter?
Get on the wrong plane, squirt?
Looks like you won' t be needing this, kid.
HARRY:
Come on!
We spent nine months in jail... thinking we had the worst luck in the universe.
MARV:
We busted out of the clink, and we' re doing fine.
We' il be doing even better... because we' re not robbing houses anymore.
Now we' re robbing toy stores.
At midnight tonight... we' re hitting Duncan' s Toy Chest.
Five floors of cash.
HARRY:
Marv!
Marv, you want to shut up?
What' s the difference?
Or the undertaker.
Let' s just get him to the subway tunnel.
I' il feel a lot better once we get him on ice.
I' ve got a gun in my pocket.
You open your mouth... and you' il be spitting gum out through your forehead.
Well, hello.
- He did it.
- Did what?
HARRY:
Get him, will ya!
He went in the park.
What are you doing?
- Hey!
- Give it!
MARV:
Hey, Harry, I got him.
Let me see.
That ain' t him.
Put him down.
That ain' t him.
I hate pulling a job knowing that creep is on the loose.
What can he do?
Kids are helpless.
Not this kid.
This time, he doesn' t have a houseful... of dangerous goodies to get us with.
He' s in the park.
He' s alone.
HARRY:
Yeah.
MARV:
Yeah.
KEVlN:
I want to go home.
Mom, where are you?
Turn that down.
- Hello.
- Kate McCallister, please.
- This is she.
- Ma' am, we found your son.
- What?
- The police know where Kevin is.
He' s in New York City.
He' s in New York.
- New York?
He checked into the Plaza with your husband' s credit card.
He' s not a troublemaker.
Would you hold just a second?
He used your credit card to check into the Plaza Hotel.
Do they still have him?
Do they have him?
No, police are still looking.
Damn it!
We' re on the next flight out.
Thank you.
We' re going to New York.
- Yes!
- Yes!
He ran away when they questioned him about the card.
He must be so scared.
Would he go to my brother' s place?
Aren' t they in Paris?
Maybe there' s a housesitter.
I thought you said they' re renovating.
Hello!
Uncle Rob?
Aunt Georgette?
Anybody home?
Hello!
Anybody home?
Uncle Rob!
Aunt Georgette!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
WOMAN:
[Laughing]
Taxi!
Boy, it' s scary out there.
Ain' t much better in here, kid.
I don' t want to ever take a vacation like this again.
Where did all you come from?
I may not have enough for everybody.
How hungry are you guys?
Well, you guys ate all my food.
Aah!
Look, I' m sorry I screamed in yourface.
You were just trying to help me, right?
I' m Kevin McCallister.
Your birds are real nice.
I' ve seen you before.
You had pigeons all over you.
At first, you looked kind of scary.
But when I think about it, it' s not so bad.
They must be all over you 'cause they like you.
If I' m bothering you, I can leave.
Am I bothering you?
No.
Good.
I' m not a pain in the butt?
No.
Will those pigeons come back on their own... or do you have to call them?
Give me your hand.
They can hear it.
This is great.
It' s pretty cold out.
I could sure go for a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you?
KEVlN:
I' d hate to spend Christmas Eve in Central Park.
WOMAN:
Yes.
[Playing "Adeste Fideles"]
Nice music.
WOMAN:
I' ve heard the world' s great music from here.
Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie...
Frank Sinatra...
Luciano Pavarotti.
So, do you bring your friends up here?
I haven' t got many friends.
Sorry.
I' m like the birds I care for.
People pass me in the street.
They see me, but they try to ignore me.
They' d prefer I wasn' t part of their city.
Yeah.
It' s sorta like that with my family.
I' m kinda the pigeon of the house... just because I' m the youngest.
Everyone fights for position.
Everybody wants to be seen... and heard.
I guess so.
I' m seen and heard pretty much... but then I get sent to my room a lot, too.
Oh.
What were you like before?
I had a job...
I had a home...
I had a family.
Did you have any kids?
No.
Oh, I wanted them... but the man I loved... fell out of love with me.
And whenever the chance to be loved came along again...
I ran away from it.
I stopped trusting people.
No offense... but that seems like sort of a dumb thing to do.
I was afraid of getting my heart broken again.
You see, sometimes you can trust a person... and then, when things are down... they forget about you.
Maybe they' re just too busy.
Maybe they don' t forget about you... but they forget to remember you.
I don' t think people mean to forget.
I think it just happens.
I' d leave it on the school bus.
I' m just afraid if I do trust someone...
I' il get my heart broken again.
I used to have a really nice pair of roller blades.
I was afraid I' d wreck them... so I kept them in the box.
- You know what happened?
- No.
I outgrew them.
I never wore them once outside... just in my room a couple of times.
A person' s heart and a person' s feelings... are very different than skates.
Well, they' re kind of the same thing.
If you just keep it to yourself... maybe it' il be like my roller blades -- when you do decide to try it... it won' t be any good.
You should take a chance.
You got nothing to lose.
A bit of truth in there somewhere.
I think so.
Your heart might still be broken... but it isn' t gone.
If it was gone, you wouldn' t be this nice.
Thank you.
Do you know that it' s been... a couple of years since I' ve talked to anybody?
That' s OK.
You' re really good at it.
You' re not boring.
You don' t mumble or spit when you talk.
You should do it more often.
[Woman laughs]
Oh, I have been working very hard... at keeping people away, haven' t l?
I always think I' il have a lot of fun if I' m alone... but being alone isn' t much fun.
I' d rather be with somebody than by myself.
So what are you doing running around the streets... on Christmas Eve alone?
Did you get into trouble?
Yeah.
You' ve done something wrong?
A lot of things.
Did you know that a good deed erases a bad deed?
It' s getting pretty late.
I don' t know if I' il have enough time... to erase all the bad deeds I did.
Well, it' s Christmas Eve.
Good deeds count for extra tonight.
- They do?
- Of course they do.
So you must think of the most important thing... that you can do for others... and go and do it.
Just follow the star in your own heart.
OK.
It' s getting pretty late.
I better get going.
If I don' t see you again, I hope everything turns out OK.
Thank you.
Say good- bye to your birds for me.
Oh, I will.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
I won' t forget to remember you.
CHlLDREN SlNGlNG:
Guide me home for Christmas
Mr. Duncan is going to donate to the Children' s Hospital.
At midnight tonight, we' re hitting Duncan' s Toy Chest.
You can mess with a lot of things... but you can' t mess with kids on Christmas.
We' d like to offer you... a complimentary suite while you' re here.
It' s a penthouse with a view of the park.
I think you' il find it satisfactory.
It was recently vacated by the Countess of Worcestershire.
What kind of hotel allows a child to check in alone?
The boy had a very convincing story.
What kind of idiots are working here?
PETER:
When you discovered the credit card was stolen --
I made the discovery.
Why did you let him leave?
When we attempted to confront him, he ran.
KATE:
It' s Christmas Eve, and because of you... our child is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world.
Could you take our family and our luggage up to the room?
Yes, sir.
Run along, Cedric.
I' m going down to the police station... and make sure they' re trying to find Kevin.
I want you to stay with the kids.
- No.
I' m going to look for him.
- What?
With all due respect, madam... your son is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world.
Could you stay out of this, please?
As you wish.
Thank you.
I don' t think it' s a good idea... for you to run around New York City all by yourself.
If our son can do it, I can do it.
Peter, I' il be fine.
The way I' m feeling... no mugger or murderer would dare mess with me.
Madam, there are hundreds of parasites... armed to the teeth --
Do bundle up.
It' s awfully cold outside.
Marv, Marv, come on.
Marv... crowbars up.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
MARV:
HARRY:
MARV:
The amazing thing is, we' re fugitives from the law... we' re up to our elbows in cash... and nobody even knows about it.
He' s back!
He took our picture!
KEVlN:
This is it.
No turning back.
Another Christmas in the trenches.
No!
Get the money!
I' il kill him!
That little friggin 'son of a dirty...
- I' m coming, Harry!
HARRY:
Harry?
Harry!
[Mutters]
I twisted my ankle on that board there.
- Where is he?
HARRY:
Come on!
MARV:
I got you.
I got you.
Taxi!
MARV:
KEVlN:
Let' s kill!
Hold on, pea- brain.
We got busted last time... because we underestimated that little bundle of misery.
This ain' t like the last time.
This ain' t his house.
The kid' s running scared.
He ain' t got a plan.
May I do the thinking, please?
Thank you.
Sonny!
Yes?
Nothing would thrill me more greatly... than to shoot you.
Knocking off a youngster... ain' t going to mean all that much to me, understand?
Mm- hmm.
But since we' re in a hurry, I' il make a deal with you.
You throw down your camera... and we won' t hurt you.
You' il never hear from us again.
OK?
You promise?
I cross my heart and hope to die.
OK.
MARV:
Direct hit!
How many fingers am I holding up, Marv?
Eight?
You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead!
Throw another one!
If you can' t do any better than that, kid... you' re gonna lose!
Harry... no.
You got any more?
Come on, Marv.
Get up.
Ha ba...
- What?
- What?
What?
Nobody throws bricks at me and gets away with it!
Marv, get up.
You go this way, I' il go around back.
Harry?
Harry?
Huh?
Harry, I' ve reached the top!
- Aah!
What a hole.
Oh!
Harry?
I' m coming up!
Ah- choo!
Yes!
Don' t you know a kid always wins against two idiots?
Harry!
He' s in the living room!
Aah!
I' m coming, Harry.
I' m coming.
Harry, Harry.
Hey, you didn' t lose any teeth.
Come on.
KEVlN:
Hey... why don' t you guys try the stairs?
Right.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Don' t you remember what happened last year?
No.
Watch this.
[Makes sound of footsteps]
Oh!
He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!
That' s one.
Don' t worry, Harry!
I' il get him!
Right in the schnozz!
That' s two.
Let' s get him.
That' s... three.
No.
That' s four.
Come on, Harry.
MARV:
Oh, yeah.
I worked all the kinks out.
[Furniture collapsing]
Like a rock, huh, Marv?
Hey, do you guys give up?
Have you had enough pain?
Never!
You better say every prayer you ever heard before!
I hope your parents got you a tombstone for Christmas!
Where' d he go?
I' m up here, and I' m really scared.
What' s that sound?
[Crunch]
Yes!
Over there!
I' m killing that kid!
MARV:
He vanished.
MARV:
Nice night for a neck injury!
HARRY:
MARV:
Oh, I don' t know.
I said, come on.
[Whimpering]
Harry?
HARRY:
That' s not aftershave.
That' s kerosene.
The rope is soaked in it.
Why would anybody soak a rope in kerosene?
Merry Christmas.
- Aah!
Ouch!
Hello.
The two guys who robbed Duncan' s Toy Chest... are at Central Park West and 95th Street.
Look for fireworks.
Hurry.
KEVlN:
Hey, I' m down here.
Whoa!
My, how the tables have turned.
[Both laughing]
Let' s go for a little stroll in the park.
Give me that bag!
Gimme it.
These will look great in the photo album.
You may have won the battle, little dude... but you lost the war.
You ought not have messed with us, pal.
We' re dangerous.
- Harry.
- Shut up.
Harry...
Shut up.
MARV:
Something' s wrong.
Let' s get out of here.
Shut up, I said!
I never made it to the sixth grade, kid... and it doesn' t look like you' re going to, either.
Let him go!
Kevin, run!
Shoot her!
Shoot her!
I' m trying to shoot her!
- Aah!
Thanks!
Jeez, it looks like the Fourth of July!
We' il take the bridge.
Let' s go.
Come on!
Oh, my God!
SECOND OFFlCER:
On yourfeet.
Take it easy.
You guys should' ve started earlier.
The prisoners have already exchanged gifts.
We missed the presents?
He made us hide out in a store... so we could steal the charity money.
- Aah!
You got the right to remain silent, you know.
He' s a little cranky.
We just broke out of prison a few days ago.
Jeez!
- Get them out of here.
- Let' s go.
Remember, if this makes the papers... we' re no longer the Wet Bandits.
Ow!
That' s "S"...
Shut it!
Mr. Duncan, it' s all over.
We apprehended the thieves, and we recovered your money.
Good.
OFFlCER:
I' il handle it personally.
Thank you very much.
I found this note.
Looks like a kid broke your window.
KATE:
Oh, excuse me.
I' m looking for my son.
He' s this boy right here.
Please help me.
This boy right here, have you seen him?
Please?
I' m looking for my son.
He' s been missing for two days.
KATE:
Yes, of course we have.
Then trust us.
We' il handle it.
Oh.
But I' m his mother.
I realize that, ma' am... but you' re looking for a needle in a haystack.
Do you have kids?
Yes, ma' am.
And what would you do if one of them was missing?
I' d probably be doing the same thing you' re doing.
Thank you.
Look, put yourself in your kid' s shoes.
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Me?
I' d probably be lying dead in a gutter somewhere.
No.
Kevin is so much stronger and braver than I am.
I know Kevin' s fine.
I' m sure he is.
But he' s still all by himself in a big city... and he doesn' t deserve that.
He deserves to be at home with his own family... around his Christmas tree.
Oh, dear God.
I know where he is.
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.
Hop in.
KEVlN:
I know I don' t deserve a Christmas... even if I did do a good deed.
I don' t want any presents.
Instead, I want to take back... every mean thing I ever said to my family.... even if they don' t take back the things they said.
I don' t care.
I' il love all of them... including Buzz.
If I can only see one, can I see my mother?
I' il never want another thing as long as I live.
I just want my mother.
I know I won' t see her tonight... but promise me I can see her again... sometime, anytime.
Even if it' s just once and only for a couple of minutes.
I just need to tell her I' m sorry.
Kevin?
Mom?
That worked fast.
KATE:
Oh, Kevin.
Mom, I' m sorry.
KEVlN:
KATE:
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Let' s go.
KATE:
I know you and Christmas trees... and this is the biggest around.
KATE:
They' re at the hotel.
[Snoring]
Holy smokes!
It' s morning!
It' s Christmas morning, man.
FULLER:
I don' t think Santa Claus visits hotels.
Are you nuts?
He' s omnipresent.
He goes everywhere.
Hey, guys, wake up!
It' s Christmas!
FRANK:
What?!
What on earth?
I wanna find out.
Where did it all come from?
Mom!
Dad!
- Gosh.
- Peter!
Are you sure we' re in the right room?
- Yeah!
- Look!
I mean it.
KATE:
Duncan?
I don' t know.
All right.
Calm down.
Hey, hey!
All right.
I think it only fair... that Kevin get to open up the first present.
Then I' il go... and the rest of you, and so on.
Merry Christmas, Kev.
PETER:
Merry Christmas, Kevin.
OK, Kevin!
Merry Christmas!
- All right!
- Everybody, wait.
Save the paper.
We can use it next year.
Give me the bows.
Merry Christmas.
Kevin!
Merry Christmas!
I got something for you.
What' s this?
It' s a turtledove.
As long as we each have a turtledove... we' il be friends forever.
Oh, Kevin.
Thank you.
I won' t forget you.
WOMAN:
Oh.
Mr. McCallister' s room service bill, sir.
Merry Christmas, sir.
Nice family.
BUZZ:
Merry Christmas, indeed.
Oh, Dad...
Kevin!
Merry Christmas
- Aah!
Close as I can figure it, the year is 1300 A. D., and I' m being dragged to my death.
It wasn' t always like this.
A job.
Shop smart.
Together, we drove to a small cabin in the mountains.
It seems an archaeologist had come to this remote place... to translate and study his latest find,
"The Book of the Dead."
Bound in human flesh and inked in blood, this ancient Sumerian text contained bizarre burial rites, funerary incantations and demon resurrection passages.
It took Linda.
How do you stop it?
All right, you men, fall in!
All o 'ya, keep a pace!
Stand fast, hellhound!
No, no.
Uh, I don' t know how I got here,
- and, uh, uh, I' m not looking for any trouble.
What a piece of armor this is!
Come on, all you men.
My lord, I believe he is the one written of in the Necronomicon.
He who' s prophesied to fall from the heavens... and deliver us from the terrors of the Deadites.
- Kneel, rapscallions!
- You miserable bast --
- Get off of me!
- Chain him!
Ah, you' re gonna have a little bit of wee fun, mate.
Come on, now.
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this!
Raise the portcullis!
Lord Arthur approaches!
That' s lovely, isn' t it?
Move it in.
- Get on!
He' s back!
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?
Aye, and fought valiantly.
But last night he fell in battle to Duke Henry' s men.
Come on.
Ah, stop it, you bastard!
- Oh, no!
Stop it!
Get outta here, you little brat!
Foul thing!
Thou art a murderer!
My brother' s death shall be avenged!
Kill them!
Put them into the pit!
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.
I am Henry the Red,
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands and leader of its peoples.
Well, hello, Mr. Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.
You ain' t leadin 'but two things right now --
Jack and shit, and Jack left town.
Shut your bleedin 'hole!
Shut your bleedin 'hole!
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur!
There is an evil awakened in this land, and while my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Henry the Red, wage war on us!
Aah!
It was you who first turned your swords on us!
And this evil has befouled my people as well!
Your people are no better than the foul corruption... that lies in the bowels of that pit.
Right, you' re no better.
May God have mercy upon your souls.
What hell- spawned thing lurks there?
Aah!
He' s escaping!
- It' s him.
He' s frightened!
Whoa!
You gotta understand, man.
I never even saw these assholes before.
- Get him in there!
- He trembles!
He' s begging!
- Henry!
We never met.
I do not think he' il listen, lad.
Look.
I' m tellin 'you, you got the wrong guy.
Uh, wh- whoa.
- Aah!
Isn' t the pit wonderful?
- Why, you --
Hey!
He says, "Spikes."
Strange one!
You know, your shoelace is untied.
Who' s next, huh?
How 'bout it?
Who wants some, huh?
Who wants to have a little?
You.
Huh?
You want a little?
Do ya?
Huh?
Now get on those horses and get outta here.
- Halt!
Thank you, generous hosts!
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.
Yeah.
See this?
- This is my boom stick!
It' s a 12- gauge, double- barreled Remington.
S- mart' s top of the line.
You can find this in the sporting goods department.
That' s right.
This sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Retails for about $109. 95.
That' s right, shop smart.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Now I swear, the next one of you primates... even touches me --
Now, let' s talk about how I get back home.
I prithee to forgive me, m' lord.
I believed thee one of Henry' s men.
Blow.
So what' s the deal?
Only the Necronomicon has the power.
Within its pages are passages that can send you back to your time.
Only you, The Promised One, can quest for it.
I don' t want your book.
Just send me back to my own time.
- You shall die!
You shall never obtain the Necronomicon!
Oh!
Get an axe.
- Catch the witch!
Have some porridge!
I' m blind!
Oh, God, I' m blind!
Yo, she- bitch.
Ya- hoo!
If the Necronomicon fell into the hands of the Deadites, all mankind will be consumed by this evil.
That one.
Hee- ya!
What' s the matter?
You raised in a barn?
Probably was raised in a barn with all the other primitives.
The wise men say that thou art The Promised One.
'Tis said that thou wilt journey for the book to help us, and that thou wilt lead our people against the evil.
The only reason I' m going to get the book is to get home.
Don' t touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect... wouldn' t understand alloys and compositions... and things with molecular structures in the --
What are you doin 'here anyway?
I wanted to say that all of my -- all of my hopes and prayers go with you, and I made this for thee.
Good, I could use a horse blanket.
Gimme some sugar, baby.
Come on, boy!
Whoa.
What?
This path will lead you to an unholy place.
- Klaatu barada nikto.
I got it, I got it!
Now you get this straight, the both of you.
Hyah!
Come on!
Aah!
Come on, you!
Hey, let' s scare this guy good!
Come on.
Ooh!
Ready, aim, fire!
- Get away!
- Oh --
Oh, no!
Uh, ooh, aah!
- Ooh, aah!
Heh heh heh- heh -- Whoa!
Hey, he' s gettin 'up.
Wait a minute.
Aah!
Geronimo!
- Hooray!
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh?
How' d you like the taste of that, huh?
How' d you like the ta --
Aah, uh, ugh, oh!
Bleh.
Where are you takin 'me?
What are you?
I' m bad Ash, and you' re good Ash.
You' re goody little two- shoes.
## You' re goody little two- shoes goody little two- shoes #
# Little goody two- shoes Little goody two- shoes #
# Little goody two- shoes Little goody two- shoes Little goody two- shoes #
# Little goody two- shoes ##
Good, bad.
I' m the guy with the gun.
Yeah, that' il teach you.
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon!
You' il die in the graveyard before you get it!
- What' s that you got on your face?
- Huh?
- Hyah!
Hyah!
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
L- Like what am I supposed to do?
Wrong book.
Ooh!
I' il get back to you.
Well... seems fairly obvious.
The words.
All right, all right, all right.
Klaatu... barada...
necktie.
Nectar, n -- nickel.
Noodle.
It' s definitely an "N" word.
Klaatu barada n --
Hey.
Everything' s cool.
I did!
No, wait!
You people, seek cover!
Seek your children!
- Steady the horses!
Something' s wrong.
Oh, oh, aah!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
I' il crush ya!
I' il mash ya into paste, you bony cre --
- Hyah!
I' m through being their garbage boy.
Now I want back, like in the deal.
I... live... again.
The Promised One!
The Promised One' s returned!
Welcome home!
We' re saved!
- Truly he is The Promised One!
- He' s brought the Necronomicon!
- He' s brought the book!
- Yeah, great, great.
The Necronomicon, quickly.
- Yeah, it' s, it' s just that -- - Just what?
Nothin '.
Now send me back.
When you removed the Necronomicon from the cradle, did you speak the words?
- Yeah, basically.
Look, maybe I didn' t say every single, little tiny syilable,
- Dung- eating fool!
Thou hast doomed us all!
Now, whoa, whoa, right there, spinach chin.
You said there was a passage that could get rid of this thing and send me back.
It' s true, the book still possesses the power to send you back, but to us it is useless!
The evil has a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon, and it will come here to get it.
I did my part, now you send me back.
As we are men of our word, we shall honor our bargain.
The wise men shall return you to your own time.
Yeah?
- I thought he was the one.
'Cause that was the deal.
So when do you think we can... start with all the thing and the --
Agh!
Wretched excuse for a man!
The wise men were fools to trust in you.
We put our trust in him.
I still believe that thou wilt help us.
Oh, Sheila, don' t you get it?
It' s over.
I didn' t have what it took.
So long.
But what of the things that we' ve shared?
What of all the sweet words that you spoke in private?
Aw, well --
That' s all.
I still have faith in thee.
I still believe that thou wilt stay and save us.
I --
Coward!
A demon!
Help me!
- Hold your arms!
You' il hit the girl!
Damn you!
Dig faster!
I shall command every worm- infested son- of- a- bitch...
- that ever died in battle!
- Thank you, sir!
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.
We shall storm their castle and get my book!
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Now pick up a shovel and get digging!
Well.
Now, ain' t you a sweet little thing?
Come on.
Move!
Have you lost your bones, you decomposed gobs?
Get thee hence!
- Whoa!
- Hey, get his horse.
My lord, an army of the dead gather in the wilderness.
- They approach the castle.
But two days' ride.
Perhaps we should leave as soon as possible.
- Yes, the mountains.
It has been foretold.
They' il swallow our souls.
- I' m afraid!
- I don' t want to die!
Go ahead and run.
Run home and cry to mama!
I' m through runnin '!
I say we stay here and fight it out.
Are all men from the future loudmouthed braggarts?
Just me.
How will we fight an army of the dead at our castle walls?
How will you fight that?
More words?
Most of our people have already fled.
We are but 60 men.
Now... who' s with me?
You can count on my steel.
- I' m with you!
We' il stay!
Hail!
Hail!
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.
I may be bad, but I feel... good.
- Who rules?
- To you, my lord.
You, sir.
To the castle.
Hurry up now.
Heave- ho.
Ha!
Hai- ya!
Hai- ya!
They' re coming!
The Deadites approach!
Maybe --
Yeah.
And maybe I' m a Chinese jet pilot.
Battle stations!
All right, get those rocks up, mister, on the double!
By God, let' s give 'em what for.
- Company, halt!
I' il rip his balls off.
Bring forth the scout!
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.
Fine, fine, fine.
There, my lord, beyond the wall.
The parapet.
That would be the most likely place.
Right.
Arrows.
Torch boy!
Steady.
Oh!
- All right!
Sire, there' s a second division approaching from the south.
Catapults.
- Seek cover!
- Watch out!
Oh!
Oh, you miserable bags of bones!
Sally for --
Sally forth.
Forward!
Hold fast!
Damn you!
Ooh, that' s gotta hurt.
Put your... backbones into it.
The castle is ours!
- Get it achieved and fast!
Have at them!
Ha!
Pull back!
Man the parapet!
God save us all.
Say hello to the 21st century.
I got plenty for everybody!
- Bye- bye.
It' s the one in the cart we want!
- Yaaah!
- We' ve secured the courtyard, my lord.
Look out!
- Hey, you' re mine, sweetie.
The book' s where we are.
The Red!
Ha- ha!
Onward, valiant cousins!
There ya go.
The book is mine.
I' il cut your gizzard out.
Get him!
Ha!
You found me beautiful once.
Honey, you got real ugly.
So you wanna play rough, eh?
Oh.
Prepare to die!
You' re going down!
- I' m comin 'for ya.
- Come on.
You' re pissin 'me off, you ugly son of a bitch!
I' il spoil those good looks.
Hold still!
We will hold!
We must protect the book!
I' ve crushed your pathetic army.
Now I' il have my vengeance.
Buckle up, bonehead, 'cause you' re goin' for a ride.
Retreat!
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.
Watch 'em, lads.
They' re an untrust worthy lot.
Move yourself, lad!
- Your hand, man.
Godspeed!
Yeah, nice goin '.
- Arthur.
- We' ve won the day.
- Yeah!
We' re brothers and a new kingdom shall be born!
The book tells us that once you drink this liquid... and recite the words, "Klaatu barada nikto," thou shalt awaken in thine own time.
Remember, you must recite the words exactly.
I thought about staying.
- But my place is here.
- So I swallowed the juice, said the words and here I am.
- Did you say... the words right this time?
Well, maybe I didn' t say every single, tiny little syilable, no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
You know that story about how you could' ve been king?
I, uh, I think it' s kind of cute.
Yeah.
Lady, I' m afraid I' m gonna have to ask you to leave the store.
Who the hell are you?
Name' s Ash.
Housewares.
I' il swallow your soul.
Come get some.
Sure, I could' ve stayed in the past.
But in my own way,
Hail to the king, baby.
So beautiful.
What' s that?
- Did you feel something?
- Yeah, I feel something.
Hey, get back here!
Turn up the music!
We' re having a party, man.
You guys are having fun.
Boat' s rocking.
Stop!
- You' re paranoid!
- Listen.
Did you hear that?
Listen, listen.
- You hear that?
- What is that?
Everybody, shh!
Stay up there.
What is that?
Come on!
Okay, we' ve had some problems at the facility.
What we' re attempting to achieve has never been done.
We' re this close to the reactivation of a human brain cell.
Doctor...... the $200 million I sunk into this company is due in great part to your research.
But when the market opens Monday...... despite my reputation, I don' t like heights.
Especially falling from them.
I' m sorry, honestly.
Tell me, Mr. Franklin, have you ever known anyone with Alzheimer' s?
Well, no.
By the end, all my father could do was ask why my mother wasn' t at home.
Each time I said she was dead, I saw him take the loss like a car wreck.
200, 000 men and women develop Alzheimer' s each year.
What if you could end all that suffering with a single pill?
48 hours.
I' il give you results that' il skyrocket your stock price...... or I' il help you pack the lab myself.
It' s your call.
That was an impressive speech you gave back there.
I read that article on you.
- The thing in the Himalayas.
- Alps.
Right.
We were just trying to do something together.
Having fun.
Things went bad.
But you saved all those people.
Not all.
Navy built it for WWII submarine loading...... refueling.
When they mothballed it, we picked it up, added aquatic pens, underwater labs.
Your dime, I guess.
Looks like Alcatraz floats.
What do you think?
She' s a 12- footer.
She' s beautiful.
- She wants to give you a big kiss.
- I bet.
She' s got a license plate jammed in her mouth.
It' s a good deal, "amigo".
Drop her, Billy!
Russell Franklin, Janice Higgins.
Marine biologist.
Jan will get you settled.
Welcome to our island paradise.
Where' s Tattoo?
You know, short guy?
"The plane, Boss!
The plane! "
Right.
I am getting old.
How much do you know about our facility?
Treat me like a tourist.
I hate tourists and I' ve decided I' m going to like you.
"Louisiana."
I think he was bought in a pet shop in Baton Rouge.
Ate everything in his tank, and then ate the guy that bought him.
Next day, fills up the cab of the guy' s truck with water and drives to Baja...... picking bones out of his teeth with the license plate.
We need to talk.
Later.
Carter Blake, Russell Franklin, president of Chimera Pharmaceuticals.
That was incredible.
Actually, they don' t like the taste of us very much.
If they bite you, it' s because they think you' re a fat little seal.
Or a rich suit.
Nice meeting you.
Friendly place.
You got full sentences.
Usually, he just kind of nods.
Word travels fast about why you' re here and all.
Was that the Gen 1 that escaped?
That little guy?
No way.
Those are the normals.
These three are the test sharks.
Two first- generation and one second- generation female.
Beneath its glassy surface...... a world of gliding monsters.
It' s pretty scary stuff, huh?
Yes.
It is.
Tower to water taxi.
Ben, I' m picking up a nasty little bitch of a squall about 30 miles out.
Over.
Copy that.
We' il be all right.
Jan, stay out of the rain.
Where are they going?
They hate me too?
They' re going home.
We run a skeleton crew on the weekend.
But they probably hate you anyway.
There' s Dr. Jim Whitlock, the most brilliant man ever.
He' s pissing into the wind.
How brilliant can he be?
You' il see.
What happened, deadeye?
You miss with the first shot?
It took two hits to even slow it down.
Are you kidding?
Two of these should' ve almost killed it.
Go tell it that, Scoggs.
You missed.
Don' t get mad at me because you can' t shoot worth a shit.
If you hadn' t left the pen open, I could' ve had a good sleep.
I already told the doc, I locked the pen like I do every night.
The fish got out some other way.
What are you looking at me like that for?
Who are you going to trust?
Me, that' s who.
You trust me.
You know why?
Because I' m trustworthy.
How high are these fences off the water?
Given the surface variations and tensile strength --
Short answer, man.
Eight feet, give or take a centimeter.
I' m sorry.
I' m making Aquatica sound like a mental hospital.
No, not really.
Well, maybe a little.
The truth is, it is.
But almost everyone here is top of their game.
Living below is like living in space.
You don' t get very many mistakes.
Besides the catwalks...... you bought us titanium- based fencing around all the lagoon and pens.
There are three sub- levels.
Sub- level One is living quarters.
Wet lab and workshops.
Engineering and air- locked wet entry.
Welcome to Aquatica.
Did you dose the Gen 2 with the serum?
I had Carter do it as soon as you called.
It should be ready tomorrow night.
- But?
- We will not be ready.
Two months ahead of schedule.
We' re skipping three rounds of preliminary trials.
No choice.
You wait your whole life for a single moment...... and then one day, it' s tomorrow.
So what exactly does a shark wrangler do?
Pretty much what it sounds like, I guess.
How' d you end up here at Aquatica?
I like the water.
Pay is good.
An AGA mask!
Did some wreck diving in one of these, off the coast of Spain.
Tourist thing.
It' s okay.
I bet you' re really good at it.
We' re on the water.
Whole cat- and- mouse thing don' t float.
You' re the man, right?
Yeah, I' m the man.
What' s it say?
Two years, Leavenworth.
Smuggling.
How' d you make your money?
You the first rich guy in history who' s squeaky- clean?
You do understand my concern, right?
Look, I got a workable deal here.
I don' t make waves.
I meet the terms of my parole.
I' m not out to change the world, like the doc.
I' m not out to wreck it either.
Eat me, asshole!
Hey, you dickhead!
Fat butt!
You got a big, fat butt.
You know what, bird?
You' re trying my last nerve.
Don' t make me drown your feathery ass.
Get myself a cat.
That' s good.
Yes.
That' s good.
That' s it.
You got a nasty- looking tongue, you know that?
Feeding time.
I' m releasing the tiger shark in 30 seconds.
Copy?
I hear you.
I' m going in.
You guys hungry?
Dr. McAlester, we have a situation up here.
Could you please come to surface level?
Dr. McAlester, could you come to surf ace level, please?
Surprise!
Happy birthday!
Damn, I hate that song.
You like the tunes there, Preach?
Carter, join us.
There' s too much woman on this deck for Scoggs to handle.
Vodka, straight.
And by the way, food was excellent, brother.
You' re that guy that got caught in that avalanche, right?
I' m the one.
Black men have enough ways to get killed...... without climbing up some mountain in the middle of nowhere.
You need to leave that to the white folks, "brother."
Happy birthday?
I' il let you know tomorrow.
How' s life underwater?
It' s a lot less complicated...... than it is on the surface.
That' s for sure.
Nice work with that new tiger shark today.
One day, you' il have to tell me how you learned that.
One day, you' il take me up on that beer and maybe I will.
It' s all work for me, Carter.
But, like you said, "One day."
Sharks never get cancer, go blind or show loss of brain activity as they age.
Unlike some people I know.
Sharks are the oldest creatures on the planet...... from a time when the world was just flesh and teeth.
By using a hormonal enhancer...... we increased this female' s forebrain to five times its normal size.
To harvest more protein.
Exactly.
A protein that may reactivate --
That will....... that will reactivate human brain cells stored in the forebrain of the shark.
I' m just amazed that we' ve come so far, so fast, without genetic tampering.
Genetic engineering to increase brain mass violates the Harvard Genetics Compact.
Not to mention Chimera policy.
They' re hunting in packs.
Like wild dogs.
They' il only eat other sharks.
You' re reading too much into it.
That Gen 1 attacked a 25- foot boat.
Am I reading too much into that too?
Did you tell Franklin?
I' m just a fish keeper, lady.
But bringing in that shark ahead of schedule was a very bad idea.
Do you like your job?
Are you threatening me, Doc?
No.
But if we don' t pull off that test tomorrow, we' re all on the street.
You' re a good man, Carter.
But with your background....
Right.
How' s Miss Smarty- Pants?
Hope she' s not as dumb as she seems.
Raise those fences like I asked?
I took care of it.
Let' s go get a beer.
US Coast Guard advisories include:
All- craft warnings for waters south of the US mainland and west of CA.
A tropical depression is generating gale- force winds...... and is associated with heavy rains and ocean swells to 30 feet or more.
Any of your nonsense, and we' il have tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight.
Fat butt!
That' s right.
You can... all you want.
Welcome to my parlor, Mr. Franklin.
Wow.
Wet lab, we' re taking a pounding up here.
Can' t see past my nose.
So I suggest you check pen monitors and lagoon monitors.
I can' t imagine there' s much visibility below.
Carter, you copy?
Okay, I' m approaching the tunnel.
Bingo.
Elvis has left the building.
We picked you up, but visibility' s near zero.
No problem.
How long have they been synchronized like this?
Tell me I didn' t see that.
They recognized that gun!
That' s impossible.
Sharks can' t swim backwards!
- Try to stay focused.
- What was that?
We lost picture in Gen 2 pen.
Okay, hold on.
Carter, do you copy?
Carter, do you copy?
Carter, talk to me, man.
Do you copy?
Cut the crap!
You' re scaring everybody.
Boarding platform engaged.
He' s got her.
Did someone order the fish?
What in God' s creation?
No, not His.
Ours.
Commencing scan.
Gen 2 is online.
Transferring exotics to remote terminals.
Vital signs to Terminal 1.
Diagnostic imaging to Terminal 2.
We' re live and in color!
BP, 67 over 43.
Heart rate, 50 BPM.
Within norm.
She' s sleeping like a baby.
Bad dream?
In position.
Vitals are stable.
Vitals?
Holding.
Aspirating 4. 5 cc.
Introducing 2 cc of the protein complex...... into cultured, inactive brain neurons of an Alzheimer' s patient.
And what you' re looking for here is lightning in a bottle.
Protein complex is interacting with the neurons.
Neurons are becoming hyperosmotic.
Membrane integrity' s improving.
They' re firing!
- They' re firing!
- One second.
Two.
Three.
- Still firing.
- Four.
Five.
Six.
6. 560 seconds.
I' il be damned.
No, sir.
For 6. 560 seconds...... you saw what it' s like not to be damned.
Congratulations.
- Impressed?
- Overly impressed.
6. 560 seconds.
Now that you' ve got this...... how long before you make something permanent?
You did it, pal.
You did it.
No!
Carter, no!
Are you insane?
Tower, we need paramedics and evac now!
All frequencies, SOS.
This is Research Station Aquatica.
I repeat:
This is Research Station Aquatica.
We have a medical emergency.
Please respond.
X- ray Alpha 2- 18.
Coming off oil platform Chiapa.
We' il take that post you' ve always wanted.
Got it.
He' s hemorrhaging!
They say the yellow butterflies are thick as clouds there, remember?
Research Station Aquatica, this is X- ray Alpha 2- 18.
Have you in sight.
Approaching from 0- 6- 0.
Copy, 2- 18.
Stay with him.
Keep talking.
Let' s move!
- I' m not this kind of doctor.
- Just keep doing what you' re doing.
Where' s the chopper?
Tower?
Come on, Brenda.
Where' s my chopper?
Franklin, this end!
Keep it coming!
Ready.
It' s all right, honey.
Hold on.
Got it.
Okay, move him out.
Let' s go!
I love you!
- Come on!
- Get up!
Come on!
Come on, Carter!
Pull up, 2- 18!
Pull up!
Damn!
I can' t get a picture.
Tower, have you got a visual?
Copy.
I can' t get anything.
- Do you copy?
- Going to back- up.
Got it!
I' m going to take this as a sign.
Where is he now?
Where is he?
- The whole system' s shut down.
- Brenda?
Are you there?
This thing is dead.
Somebody, please...... tell me what that is.
Please.
All right, people, let' s move.
Now!
Get to the door!
Come on.
You can' t help him.
- The door frame is bent.
- Open.
Open it!
Turn it!
Turn it!
No!
Tower, can you hear me?
Anyone, hello?
We got to get topside, find some help.
What?
We' re flooded.
Shit!
There' s no other stairway from this level.
Elevator?
It seals off automatically to keep the shaft from filling.
There' s no way up.
All right.
Okay.
If this is a lesson about the drinking, let' s just say I' ve learned it.
No need to get carried away, showing me your vengeful side.
I know Your wrath, Lord.
If Corridor B is dry...... we go back to the maintenance ladder, climb down to Level 3.
We get to the wet entry.
We take the sub topside, two at a time.
We go down to get up.
All right, let' s move.
Come on.
Sounds like somebody made it.
Over here!
We' re over here!
Preach?
What the hell is that?
Lab equipment maybe, banging around.
Think so?
Not a chance.
We got to get past that door.
Let' s go!
Come on!
Open the door!
Go!
Go!
Bird!
Come on, bird!
Where are you, bird?
Hey, dickhead!
Bird?
Fat butt!
Bird?
Anybody here?
- Cowboy, let me ask you a question.
- We should keep moving.
I' m talking to him!
Was that a goddamn shark that broke through that door?
I expect so.
You expect so?
Well, well, well.
Am I the only asshole down here who thinks that a tad bit odd?
It can do that?
Bust through a steel door?
I ain' t the expert.
Given Gen 2' s size and some room to move...... she could put a couple tons, maybe more, into a hit.
So, yeah, in my opinion.
If she wants through, she' s coming.
And these sharks...... they aren' t breaking down doors for the sheer joy of it, are they?
They' re after us.
It' s obvious we don' t know what they' re doing.
What the hell did you do to those sharks?
Their brains weren' t large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein.
So we violated the Harvard Compact.
Jim and I used gene therapies to increase their brain mass.
Larger brain means more protein.
As a side effect, the sharks got smarter.
You stupid bitch!
I didn' t want this to happen...... but with this research, we could wipe out degenerative brain disease.
Think of the generations that would be saved.
How much dynamite do you have to set off in your ears before your head clears?
You wouldn' t understand.
I wouldn' t?
Dumb old Carter wouldn' t understand that you used us?
That you used me?
Someone on the water who wouldn' t make waves.
Someone who wouldn' t ask too many questions.
Because he had something to lose.
You don' t see what we' ve done here.
You' ve taken God' s oldest killing machine and given it will and desire.
You' ve knocked us to the bottom of the goddamn food chain.
It' s not a great leap forward, in my book.
The people we' il save....
Jim?
Brenda?
Us?
All right, people.
These sharks are thinking hard and clear.
So here' s the riddle.
What does an 8, 000- pound mako shark...... with a brain the size of a V8 engine and no natural predators, think about?
I' m not waiting around here to find out.
Now you see how that works?
She screwed with the sharks and now the sharks are screwing with us.
Please let me get out of here.
What if the sharks get through the fence and into the ocean?
It' s okay.
The fence on the ocean side is titanium.
And it gives, so it works just like a net.
Let' s get to the sub.
We' il discuss it on the way to the top.
Eat me, asshole.
Careful, now.
Come on, bird.
Come on.
Please, baby.
Dickhead.
See Daddy smiling?
Come on.
Bring your feathery ass here.
Come on.
- Explosion caused that?
- No.
Nothing in here could' ve blown with enough force to move that damn sub.
Whatever.
It' s junk.
We could all just dive in and see who makes it to the top.
Isn' t that the old Aquatica spirit, Dr. Susie?
Just dive in.
You could go first, to lead by example.
He was my best friend, Janice.
I' m not going in the water.
- No way, man!
The sharks are in there.
- Listen!
We put these on.
They help fight hypothermia.
That' s a start.
And unless someone' s got a better idea...... we' re going to have to swim out of here.
This isn' t happening.
I' m not Daniel when he faced the lion!
So I appreciate the irony, Lord!
"Cook dies in his own oven!"
But I' ve got other plans!
You ate my bird.
Was that the surface?
No, the vibrations are too deep.
That was from inside.
I wouldn' t get that close.
Just a suggestion.
Water' s murky.
We might make it.
No way!
No, we won' t!
It' s 230 feet...... from the lagoon floor to the lagoon surface!
The average human swims two feet per second.
The average shark swims 50 feet per second.
There' s no way I' m getting into that pool!
What we have here is your basic maintenance ladder.
This leads up to the surface.
I love you, Scoggs.
I really do!
Why do I feel a "but" coming on?
But we don' t know what shape the surface level is in.
The shaft is air- locked.
But if the explosion breached the shaft at surface level...... we won' t have enough pressure to stabilize the wet pool.
If the pool isn' t stabilized, there' s tons of ocean dying to get in.
You' il bring the whole facility down.
We' re better off with the sharks.
You want to swim with your fishes?
Go ahead!
I' m opening this door and climbing out of here!
- The hell you are!
- I don' t work for you anymore!
- I don' t have to take orders!
- Enough!
That' s enough now, from all of you!
You think water' s fast?
You should see ice.
It moves like it has a mind.
Like it knows it killed the world once.
It got a taste for murder.
When the avalanche came...... it took us a week to climb out.
And somewhere we lost hope.
I don' t know when we turned on each other.
I just know...... that seven of us survived the slide...... and only five made it out.
Now, we took an oath that I' m breaking now.
Swore that we' d say it was the snow that killed the other two.
But it wasn' t.
Nature can be lethal.
But it doesn' t hold a candle to man.
You' ve seen how bad things can get and how quick they can get that way.
Well, they can get a whole lot worse.
So we' re not going to fight anymore!
We' re going to pull together and find a way to get out of here!
First, we' re going to seal off this pool!
Oh, my God.
It just ate him.
It just ate him.
Christ!
I' m not moving.
I' m not moving.
Someone will come.
They' il come and they' il get us, and we' il be fine.
No.
I' m not moving.
Listen, Tom, what is the precise structural failure limit for Aquatica?
3, 200 tons.
What happens when we get more than 3, 200 tons of water in this rig?
The support struts go first.
Their tolerance is about seven tons.
They' il crack like toothpicks.
The walls will buckle.
They can' t handle more than 10 tons of pressure.
You want to be here for that?
Hell, no.
The moment of truth.
Again.
Go!
Go!
Go!
I got you.
It' s burning!
The elevator' s blocking the top.
If we make it to Level 1, we can take the stairs out.
Let' s get out of here!
Go!
What are you doing?
If they break through, water will bring them right to us.
Level 2 is only partially flooded.
If I can get that door open...... the water will run off there, buy us some time.
Big, real big.
- What' s that?
- The size of your brass balls.
Be careful.
Go!
Jan, stay there!
Get me out of here, Carter!
I don' t want to die!
Grab my hand!
Come on!
I can' t!
I can' t reach!
- Take it!
- I can' t reach!
Can you reach that door above you?
It' s too high.
It' s too high.
Sharks probably flooded that level too.
Good thing you came to this side.
The other side' s underwater.
- We didn' t exactly plan it.
- Yeah, it wasn' t planned.
Are you all that made it?
We did it.
We' re on Level 1.
We can take the stairs to the surface.
The stairs are flooded.
Trust me, I know.
Are you sure?
Give us a goddamn break, can' t You?
He always answers.
Sometimes, the answer you get isn' t the answer you want.
We' re 60 feet from the surface.
There' s an emergency hatch on this level, right?
This level has bilge pumps on it for storm runoff.
If we re- route the emergency generators, we could drain a stairway.
You sure?
Who you going to trust?
- You.
- That' s right.
You trust me.
We had poker here tomorrow night.
She' d always draw to the inside straight when she could' ve stuck with a pair.
Big dreams.
Standards.
Jan was a healthy girl.
Something in here has to run on batteries.
- Nice.
- Where would a girl keep her...... thing?
What' s the matter with you?
My skin' s starting to hemorrhage.
The sharks smell the blood.
This' il coat it with oil.
Look, Carter, what you said down there...... maybe you were right.
Everything I' ve done...... I don' t think I could' ve done it without you.
I know, Susan.
That' s the problem.
Four a. m.
I know.
One night feels like a whole week.
Relativity.
What do you mean?
Einstein' s theory of relativity.
Grab hold of a hot pan, a second can seem like an hour.
Put your hands on a hot woman...... an hour can seem like a second.
It' s all relative.
I spent four years at Cal Tech.
That' s the best physics explanation I' ve heard.
It works.
You stay with the doc.
Me and Scoggs are going to try to get to the wet lab...... drain that stairwell.
- Preach?
- What?
Would you zip me up, please?
We got one, there' s two sharks left...... and you and the doc are doing a little bathroom love.
They got a pill for what' s wrong with you?
I need to get some things from my quarters.
Research data.
The tests, they worked.
So much death around us, to risk any more life for some numbers....
Without that data, everyone dying isn' t just tragic, it' s useless.
Death is always useless, Doctor.
This is it.
Stay here.
I' il be back before you know it.
What the hell' s going on?
What is that?
It' s okay!
- What is that?
- We' re all right!
- What the fuck?
- It' s okay.
I thought you were coming back for me.
One of your monitors is blocking the panel.
You want to help me move it?
I say we do everything right together.
Right together.
Hello.
My name is Sherman Dudley...... and if this message finds you, I did not survive, so this is my legacy.
I have loved the pulpit and I have loved the bottle.
I did my best to be a good husband, a f ather.
I came up wanting.
So what do I have to say to you?
What mark do I have to leave behind?
We' il begin with the perfect omelet, made with two eggs, not three.
Amateurs often add milk for density.
This is a mistake.
Come on!
I got you.
Come on.
Damn you, Scoggs.
Where' s Susan?
I' m done.
Brothers never make it out of situations like this.
Not ever!
Did you do it?
Where' s Scoggins?
I hate to interrupt this moment of burgeoning intimacy...... but can we get the fuck out of here?
- Is this the only way?
- Exits are flooded.
Whole place is sinking.
It' s this way or no way at all.
You can bring on the good news anytime now.
Sharks are attracted to churning water, bright colors.
These extinguishers will be a distraction.
What about us?
The vest' il bring you up too fast.
Your lungs' il pop like a balloon.
You weren' t the sunny kid in your class.
I never went to class.
Sixty feet?
There' s nothing to it.
Exhale on the way up, and get the hell out of the water.
I got to equalize the pressure before we blow the air lock.
I got to let the room fill up with water.
It' il only take a few seconds.
You ready?
No.
Not in the least.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
"... I shall fear no evil...
"... for Thou art with me...
"... Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life..."... because I carry a big stick...... and I' m the meanest motherfucker in the valley.
Two sharks down, Lord.
One demon fish to go.
Can I get an "amen"?
Amen!
- I can' t hear you!
- Amen!
Give me an "amen"!
- Stay with us, Lord!
- Amen.
Okay, hold on three!
Ready?
One!
Two!
Three!
Swim!
Oh, my God!
It' s the devil, you know.
He' il be okay if we can get out of here.
Son of a bitch.
What?
Those fences are titanium underneath, but on top, they' re just plain steel.
They' ve been herding us, pushing us where they want.
Using us to flood the facility.
Oh, my God.
That' s the answer to the riddle.
Because that' s what an 8, 000- pound mako thinks about.
About freedom.
About the deep blue sea.
We have to kill her.
That' s the first real smart thing you' ve said all day.
Here we go.
Let' s go.
We ought to get 2. 5 sticks of dynamite out of these flares.
From up here, you ought to be able to see me spear it.
When I do, you take this end of this cable...... hook it up to the positive side of the boat battery.
And boom!
Damn!
I can' t get her!
She' s too far away!
I know how to get her.
How?
Bait.
She may be the smartest animal in the world...... but she' s still just an animal.
Come to Mama.
No!
Susan, don' t!
Get out of the water!
All right, Lord....
Shoot it, Preach!
This is for Scoggins.
Shoot it!
Damn!
Blow it, Preach!
Blow it!
The battery!
Blow it!
Do it!
Bring me some sushi!
Forty- five- foot shark...... and you hit me.
Nice.
Could' ve been worse.
I could' ve let him eat your ass.
Carter, we' re sinking, right?
Yeah.
Let me ask you something.
Are you sure it was just three sharks?
Yeah.
That' s more like it.
Here comes the next shift.
Let me tell you, man...... I quit this job.
Take me back to the ghetto.
Amen.
Mr Najsman
At the beginning of the 21st century, the Umbrella Corporation... had become the largest commercial entity in the United States.
Nine out of every ten homes contain its products.
Its political and financial influence is felt everywhere.
In public, it is the world' s leading supplier... of computer technology, medical products and health care.
Unknown even to its own employees... its massive profits are generated by military technology... genetic experimentation and viral weaponry.
All Umbrella staff must wear their identity tags at all times.
All radiation badges will be collected at 5: 00 p. m. this afternoon.
Thank you!
God!
Some people.
Yeah.
- Don' t show this to me.
- Why not?
Because I' m busy.
It' s nothing.
Fire drill.
- What is that?
- Fire drill.
- Shit!
- Hey, what the hell is going on?
- Get the computers covered!
Move it!
- Damn it, I' m trying!
The experiments!
Move them!
Shouldn' t the doors open or something?
It' s supposed to take us to the nearest floor.
What' s happening?
Line' s dead.
- What' s the problem?
- The doors won' t open.
- What about the ones at the back?
- Locked as well.
There' s no fire here!
No fire!
- The code doesn' t work!
- No fire!
- What' s wrong with you?
- The door won' t open!
And this water isn' t going anywhere.
- What?
- It' s a sealed room.
- Help me with the door!
- Oh, fuck the doors!
We have to get out of here.
What' s going on?
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.
- We have to get out of here!
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!
- Quiet!
What is that?
Oh, my God.
Halon!
Stop it!
Stop!
Help!
Let me see.
We' re gonna have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building!
Here, give me a hand.
That' s as far as they' il go.
They' re caught on something.
That' s wide enough.
I' il get help.
I' m stuck.
You' re gonna have to push.
That' s it.
A bit more.
What was that?
Oh, Christ!
It' s the brakes!
- I can' t move!
- We have to get out of here!
Push her out of the way!
Pull me back inside!
Pull me back inside!
Hello?
- Who are you?
- Move!
Stop!
- Get away from me!
- Down!
What are you doing?
I' m a cop!
I told you, I' m a cop!
You' re breaking my arm!
Report.
Report now.
What?
I want your report, soldier.
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Sir, the house' s primary defenses have been activated.
She' s probably still suffering the side effects.
What are you doing with us?
What about the cop?
I' m not getting a match.
Who are you?
They probably don' t even have me on file yet.
It' s possible.
Should I secure him here?
No.
We take him with us.
You can' t do this!
Blow me.
Prep for entry to the Hive.
Power' s down.
- So fix it.
- I' m on it.
Are you done yet?
Jumpy.
Stand clear!
- You got a problem?
- How' s that door?
- It' s sealed shut.
- Let me.
Jumpy?
Lie still.
Lie still!
Watch this light.
Follow it.
- Now, how many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.
Good.
Now tell me your name.
I don' t know.
He' s fine.
Memory loss, just like the other one.
Let' s open that door.
Listen to me.
I want to know who you people are... and I want to know what' s going on here.
Now!
You and I have the same employer.
We all work for the Umbrella Corporation.
The mansion above us is an emergency entrance to the Hive.
You are security operatives placed there to protect that entrance.
What about this?
Your marriage is a fake.
Just part of your cover to protect the secrecy of the Hive.
And what is the Hive?
Show them.
Accessing schematic of the Hive.
Accessing schematic of the Hive.
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.
The mansion where we found you... and through which we gained access to the train... which, in turn, brought us to the Hive.
The Hive itself is located underground... deep beneath the streets of Raccoon City.
A top- secret research facility... owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation... the Hive houses over 500 technicians, scientists and support staff.
They live and work underground.
Their research is of the highest importance.
Its nature is classified.
Our position on the map is indicated by heat signature.
Why can' t I remember anything?
The Hive has its own defense mechanisms... all computer- controlled.
A nerve gas was released into the house.
Primary effect of the gas -- complete unconsciousness lasting anything up to four hours.
Secondary effects are varied, but can include acute memory loss.
- For how long?
- Subjective.
An hour, day, week.
So you' re saying this place was attacked?
I' m afraid things are a little more complicated than that.
Sir!
We' ve breached the Hive.
J. D.
Got it.
Halon content has dissipated.
Makes it easier to work underground, thinking there' s a view.
Looks like we' re taking the stairs.
- Status.
- Red Queen is locked onto us.
She knows that we' re here.
Who' s the Red Queen?
State- of- the- art artificial intelligence.
She is the computer that controls the Hive.
This is gonna slow us down.
Our route to the Queen takes us straight through these labs.
Rain, J. D., see how bad the flooding is.
Kaplan, find us an alternate route.
What happened here?
Five hours ago, Red Queen went homicidal.
Sealed the Hive and killed everyone down here.
- Jesus.
- When we realized what was happening... my team was dispatched to shut her down.
Why did she do it?
That we don' t know.
But outside interference is a possibility.
Jesus!
You okay?
- Here.
- No.
- I' m fine.
- Please, come on.
It' s cold in here.
Are you --
Do you remember anything from before this?
Nothing before the train.
And you?
No.
Nothing.
I found an alternate route, but it' s gonna cost us time.
We double back, cut through Dining Hall B... then we' re right on track.
Sir, no go.
The whole level' s flooded.
All right, we' re behind schedule.
So let' s move it.
Come on.
Poor bastards.
Dining Hall B.
That' s what it says on the map.
Maybe you' re reading it wrong.
Maybe the corporation' s keeping a few secrets down here.
Something you' re not supposed to see.
J. D., you and Rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit.
Sir, halon levels are nonexistent in this room.
I think the system malfunctioned.
All right.
There may be survivors.
Give me a search line, but keep it tight.
Move it.
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.
I' m not sure I want to remember what went on down here.
I don' t blame you.
What do they keep in these things?
How do I know?
What' s taking so long?
Red Queen' s defenses are in place.
She' s making it difficult.
Let' s pack it up.
You stay here.
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.
Running the bypass.
Checkmate.
Move up.
- What is that?
- That' s what will shut the Queen down.
Delivers a massive electrical charge.
Scrambles the mainframe and forces it to reboot.
Some kind of dormant defense mechanism.
- Opening the door tripped it.
- Put it back to sleep.
Working on it.
- Would you open that door now, please?
- I' m trying.
Hold your positions.
Everyone stay calm.
What' s that?
- Kaplan, quick!
- We gotta get them out of there!
- Kaplan, you' ve gotta hurry!
- Come on!
Down!
Get down!
Something' s killing them!
- Jesus!
Come on, man.
Don' t do this to me!
Medic!
Medic!
- Open the door!
- Open this door!
- I am trying.
- Stay conscious.
You' re going into shock.
Stay awake!
- I am almost there.
- Sir!
It' s coming back!
- Open the door!
- I' m trying!
Well, try harder!
It' s coming back!
Oh, God!
- Just do it!
- I' m almost there.
Come on!
- Shit!
- Got it.
All right.
Let' s do it.
Do what?
We have to complete the mission.
There is no way I' m going down there.
Her defenses are down.
Déjà vu, anyone?
Keep going.
Give me a hand.
Get out!
Get out!
You can' t be in here.
Don' t listen to anything she says.
She' s a holographic representation of the Red Queen.
You have to get out!
Modeled after the head programmer' s daughter.
She' il try to deceive us, confuse us.
I wouldn' t advise this.
Disabling me will result in loss of primary power.
She' il say anything to stop us from shutting her down.
I implore you.
- Implore away.
- Please?
Please?
You' re all going to die down here.
That pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds.
After that, if I don' t have her board, she can reboot.
They' re late.
I' m on it.
J. D., we got a survivor!
It' s okay.
We' re here to help.
You seem to be in some serious --
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
J. D., get her off of me before I stab her ass!
Are you okay?
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk clean right out of me.
Stay down.
I' m warning you, stay down!
She' s crazy.
Come any closer, and I' il fire.
I mean it!
Damn you.
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?
Bitch isn' t standing now.
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed.
She bit me.
She' s gone.
She' s gone!
That' s bullshit!
She fell right here, but she' s gone!
Look, look at this.
There' s blood, but it' s not much.
Looks like it' s coagulated.
- Yeah.
- It' s not possible.
Why not?
Because blood doesn' t do that till after you' re dead.
Can we go now?
We' re not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here.
- There' s no one else coming.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
Wait.
Quiet.
Fuck!
Don' t come any closer!
They' re behind us.
Jesus!
They' re everywhere.
They' re everywhere.
They' re all around us.
I said stay back!
Why aren' t they dying?
Watch the tank!
The tank!
- Let' s go!
- Hurry up!
- Wait!
- Come on, let' s go!
- Move!
- Keep moving!
Come on!
Move!
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes, surveillance plans, the works.
Shit!
- We lost the others!
- Keep moving!
- You waited?
- Didn' t know the code.
Come on, come on.
- Shit!
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Hurry up.
- Come on, man.
- Shit!
- What' s taking so long?
- I' m trying!
Come on.
- Move!
What' s the code?
- Hurry up!
I' m running out of ammo!
Zero, four, three, two -- No, five!
- What?
- Zero, four, three --
- What is the code?
- Zero, four... zero, three, one... nine, six, five.
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?
- Shit!
- J. D., no!
Grab my hand, man!
Come on!
Don' t let go!
- J. D.!
- Rain!
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go?
Fuck!
Whatever they are, there' s too many of them out there.
Whatever they are?
It' s pretty obvious what they are.
Lab coats, badges.
Those people used to work here!
All the people working here are dead.
Well, that isn' t stopping them from walking around.
Well, where did they come from?
Why didn' t we see them on the way in?
When you cut the power, you unlocked the doors.
You let them out.
We' re never gonna make it to the surface.
You are security operatives.
Security operatives placed there to protect that entrance.
I' ve got one in the breech and an extra mag.
Lisa?
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes, surveillance plans, the works.
But?
- But there' s gonna be a price.
- Name it.
- Who was she?
- My sister.
Corporations like Umbrella think they' re above the law.
But they' re not.
There are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same... all over the world.
Some of us provide information... others give their support.
Some take more direct action.
Like you.
If your friends had been a little more thorough... they would' ve seen right through my false ID.
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP, all the rest.
There' s no way I could' ve infiltrated the Hive.
So you sent your sister.
We needed something concrete.
Anything to expose Umbrella to the press.
Proof of the research that was going on down here.
What kind of research?
The illegal kind.
Genetic.
Viral.
My sister was going to smuggle out... a sample of the virus they were developing.
So how was she going to make it out of here?
She had a contact within the Hive, someone I never met.
They had access to security codes, surveillance, everything she needed.
So why didn' t she make it?
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.
Maybe they set her up.
Kept the virus for themselves.
Do you know how much the T- virus would be worth on the open market?
- What, worth all this?
- Yeah.
To someone.
Don' t shoot!
Don' t shoot!
- Close that door!
- They' re right behind us!
Get off!.
Get off!.
Stop it!
Son of a bitch!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Right behind us.
What about this door?
- They' re waiting out there too.
- And that way?
It' s a dead end.
There' s no way out of the Queen' s chamber.
So we wait.
If someone doesn' t hear from you, they' il send backup or something.
Right?
What?
What' s wrong?
We don' t have much time.
You know those blast doors we passed... on the way in from the mansion?
They seal shut in just under an hour.
If we' re not out of here by then, we' re not getting out.
What are you talking about?
They can' t just bury us alive down here.
Containing the incident is the only fail- safe plan they had... against possible contamination.
And you' re only telling us this now, when we' re trapped... half a mile underground?
We have to find a way out of this room.
What are you doing?
- Where are you taking those?
- I' m turning her back on.
- That is not a good idea.
- She' il know a way out of here.
That homicidal bitch killed my team.
That homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here.
Considering the way she' s being treated, I' m sure she' il be happy to help us out.
That circuit breaker you were talking about.
- Can you bypass it?
- Yeah.
So do it.
All right, circuit breaker is disabled.
This time if I hit the switch, she won' t be able to shut down.
She' s gonna fry.
Kaplan?
The initial charge must have damaged her boards.
Ah, there you are.
Things, I gather, have gone out of control.
Give me that fucking switch right now.
I' m gonna fry your ass.
I did warn you, didn' t I?
Tell us what' s going on down here.
Research and development.
What about the T- virus?
The T- virus was a major medical breakthrough... although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications.
How does it explain those things out there?
Even in death, the human body still remains active.
Hair and fingernails continue to grow.
New cells are produced... and the brain itself holds a small electrical charge... that takes months to dissipate.
The T- virus provides a massive jolt... both to cellular growth... and to those trace electrical impulses.
Put quite simply... it reanimates the body.
It brings the dead back to life?
Not fully.
The subjects have the simplest of motor functions.
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.
They are driven by the basest of impulses... the most basic of needs.
Which is?
The need to feed.
How do you kill them?
Severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain... are the most effective methods.
You mean shoot them in the head.
Why did you kill everybody down here?
The T- virus escaped into the air conditioning system... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.
The virus is protean... changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission... depending on its environment.
It' s almost impossible to kill.
I couldn' t allow it to escape from the Hive... so I took steps.
- Steps.
- You must understand.
Those who become infected, I can' t allow you to leave.
Whoa.
We' re not infected.
Just one bite, one scratch from these creatures is sufficient... and then you become one of them.
A check of my systems indicates my main drive circuit breaker... has been disabled.
May I ask why?
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.
If you refuse to help at any time, we flip the switch.
Understand?
After you.
What the hell is this place?
The utility tunnels.
They run underneath the Hive for water, gas and power lines.
- It' s been in here before.
- Keep moving.
- We' re going around in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave us.
- Why are you listening to her?
- Enough already!
We have no choice but to keep moving 'cause those things are right behind us.
That mesh isn' t gonna hold.
Keep moving.
Jesus Christ!
Hold it!
There' s too many of them!
- Jesus!
- Fuck!
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!
Quickly, everyone!
- Let' s go!
- Come on!
There' s a way up!
Watch out!
Keep 'em back!
Go on up!
Move it!
Okay.
Get over here!
Come on!
Go, go, go!
Go on!
Go!
I can manage!
Gotcha!
Rain?
Rain.
What?
We have to do something about your wounds.
I' m fine.
I said I' m fine.
You like that, don' t you?
Huh?
You like the way it tastes, don' t you?
Like the taste of that?
She was right.
We' re all gonna die down here.
No.
We' re getting out.
All of us.
Kaplan, are you okay?
Oh, God!
Hold on!
- Help him.
- I can' t.
- What are you waiting for?
- I can' t focus!
I can' t see!
- Kaplan, go up!
- Get up there!
You almost got it.
Keep going!
- Come on!
Come on!
- You can do it!
You got it!
- Okay, Kaplan.
- Just stay there!
Hold on.
We' re gonna come get you.
Cut this wire and throw it to him.
Then we can go get him.
Hold on!
That' s lucky.
I want you to go.
- We' re not leaving you, Kaplan.
- Yes, you are.
You can' t kill all of them.
And I' m not going anywhere.
I want you to go.
Now!
Please.
Just do it.
Just do it now!
Please.
Go!
You' re gonna have to work for your meal!
Come on.
Give me your arm.
Up over my shoulder.
Ready?
There we go.
I think I' m gonna get laid.
Yeah.
You might want to clean up a little bit first.
Hey, wait.
Are you okay?
Blue for the virus.
Green for the antivirus.
- What are you talking about?
There' s a cure.
The process can be reversed.
There' s a cure!
You' re gonna be okay!
I was beginning to worry.
This is where they kept the T- virus.
How do you know all this?
Because I was gonna steal it.
I was your sister' s contact.
- You betrayed her.
- I don' t know.
- You caused all of this.
- I can' t remember.
The truth.
I don' t remember the truth.
I don' t understand!
It' s gone.
It' s not there.
I can' t.
I just can' t.
It' s over.
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes, surveillance plans, the works.
But there' s gonna be a price.
Name it.
You have to guarantee me that you will bring this corporation down.
Spence?
Thank you.
Spence?
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.
We can have everything we' ve ever wanted.
Money' s out there waiting.
You wouldn' t believe how much.
Is that how you thought all my dreams were gonna come true?
Please.
I wouldn' t want to shoot you.
Might need the bullets.
Back off.
I won' t take any part in this.
Okay, but you can' t just... wash your hands of this.
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.
I was trying to stop them.
You really believe that... people like him... will ever change anything?
Nothing... ever changes.
Where is... the antivirus?
It' s on the train... where you found me.
Couldn' t have been standing more than three feet from it.
I so nearly made it out.
Didn' t realize that bitch of a computer had defense systems outside the Hive.
In or out?
In... or out?
I don' t know what we had... but it' s over.
Back... the fuck off.
I' m missing you already.
Your boyfriend' s a real asshole.
He shot the locking mechanism out.
He shot the locking mechanism out.
I can' t believe that son of a bitch is gonna get away with this.
I don' t think so.
I' ve been a bad, bad girl.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck is that?
One of the Hive' s early experiments... produced by injecting the T- virus directly into living tissue.
The results were unstable.
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA, it will mutate...
becoming a stronger, faster hunter.
Great.
If you knew it was loose, why didn' t you warn us?
'Cause she was saving it for us.
Isn' t that right?
I didn' t think any of you would make it this far.
Not without infection.
Why didn' t you tell us about the antivirus?
This long after infection... there' s no guarantee it would work.
But there' s a chance, right?
I don' t deal in chance.
Fuck it.
No pressure, guys.
You require the four- digit access code.
I can give you the code, but first you must do something for me.
- What do you want?
- One of your group is infected.
I require her life for the code.
The antivirus is right there on the platform.
- It' s right there!
- I' m sorry.
It' s a risk I cannot take.
She' s right.
It' s the only way.
You' re gonna have to kill me.
Otherwise we all die down here.
The glass is reinforced... but it won' t hold forever.
- Do it.
- No.
- Get up.
- Just do it.
- Rain, please get up.
- Do it!
- You don' t have long to decide.
- Get up, please.
- You have no choice.
- Kill her.
Kill her now.
You don' t have any choice.
- Just do it now!
- I can' t!
- Please.
- Do it.
- Kill her.
- Just do it.
Kill her now!
Kill her!
The bitch wouldn' t open the door, so I had to fry her.
Move.
What the fuck was that?
It' s a long story.
Start it up.
I' il get the virus.
I' m missing you already.
Okay, we' re in business.
Full power.
We' re leaving!
I don' t want to be one of those things... walking around without a soul.
You won' t.
When the time comes... you' il take care of it.
No one else is gonna die.
Okay?
Here.
I' m not dead yet.
I think I' il have that back.
I could kiss you, you bitch.
What' s going on back there?
- Get us the fuck out of here!
- Any faster, we' il come off the rails!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Now!
I failed all of them.
I failed.
Listen to me.
There is nothing else you could' ve done.
The corporation' s guilty here, not you.
And we finally have the proof.
That way Umbrella can' t get -- get away with this.
What is it?
You' re infected, but you' re gonna be okay.
I' m not losing you.
Help!
Help him.
What are you doing?
Matt!
He' s mutating.
I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Get off!.
What' s happening?
Matt!
I want her quarantined.
Close observation and a full series of blood tests.
Let' s see if she' s infected.
Take her to the Raccoon City facility.
Then assemble the team.
We' re reopening the Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
Just do it.
Who' s in there?
Let me out!
Let me out!
Who' s in there?
Senator, we' re making our final approach into Coruscant.
Very good, Lieutenant.
We made it.
There was no danger at all.
Cordé.
Milady, I' m so sorry.
I' ve failed you, Senator.
No.
Milady, you' re still in danger here.
- I shouldn' t have come back.
- This vote is very important.
Cordé did hers.
Now, come.
Senator Amidala, please.
More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
- If they do break away -- - I will not let this Republic... that has stood for a thousand years be split in two.
My negotiations will not fail.
If they do, you must realize there aren' t enough Jedi to protect the Republic.
We' re keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
Do you think it will really come to war?
Hmm, the dark side clouds everything.
Impossible to see the future is.
The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor.
- [Huttese]
Send them in.
We will discuss this matter later.
Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform -- terrible.
Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.
Do you have any idea who was behind this attack?
Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi.
He couldn' t assassinate anyone.
It' s not in his character.
But for certain, Senator... in grave danger you are.
Master Jedi, may I suggest... the senator be placed... under the protection of your graces.
Do you really think that' s a wise decision under these stressful times?
The situation is that serious?
No, but I do, Senator.
I realize all too well that additional security... might be disruptive for you... but perhaps someone you' re familiar with.
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.
He' s just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.
Please?
The thought of losing you... is unbearable.
I will have Obi- Wan report to you immediately, milady.
Thank you, Master Windu.
You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.
- I haven' t felt you this tense... since we fell into that nest of gundarks.
You fell into that nightmare, Master... and I rescued you, remember?
Oh... yes.
You' re sweating.
Take a deep breath.
I haven' t seen her in ten years, Master.
Obi?
Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, Jar Jar.
- Senator Padmé.
Desa Jedi arriven.
It' s a great pleasure to see you again, milady.
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.
Ani?
My goodness, you' ve grown.
Well, f- for a senator, I mean.
Ani, you' il always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.
I' m Captain Typho of Her Majesty' s security service.
Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment.
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.
The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit.
I need answers.
I want to know who' s trying to kill me.
We are here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation.
We will fiind out who' s trying to kill you, Padmé.
- I promise you.
- We will not exceed our mandate... my young Padawan learner.
I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master.
We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin...
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
What?
Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to fiind the killer?
Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.
We will do exactly as the council has instructed.
And you will learn your place, young one.
Perhaps with merely your presence... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed.
I will retire.
I know I' il feel better having you here.
I' il have an offiicer stationed on every floor, and I' il be in the control center downstairs.
Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani.
She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar.
I' ve thought about her every day since we parted, and... she' s forgotten me completely.
Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.
You' re focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.
She was pleased to see us.
Now, let' s check the security.
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.
We' il have to try something more subtle this time, Zam.
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.
They' re very poisonous.
Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.
No assassin would try that way.
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.
I don' t like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
- What' s going on?
Ah, she covered the cameras.
I don' t think she liked me watching her.
What is she thinking?
She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder.
There are many other ways to kill a senator.
I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don' t we, Master?
You' re using her as bait.
It was her idea.
No harm will come to her.
I can sense everything going on in that room.
Trust me.
It' s too risky.
Besides, your senses aren' t that attuned, my young apprentice.
And yours are?
Possibly.
You look tired.
Because of your mother?
I don' t know why I keep dreaming about her.
Dreams pass in time.
I' d much rather dream about Padmé.
Just being around her again is... intoxicating.
They betray you.
You' ve made a commitment to the Jedi order, a commitment not easily broken.
And don' t forget, she' s a politician, and they' re not to be trusted.
She' s not like the others in the senate, Master.
It is my experience that senators... focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they' re in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy...
- in order to get those funds.
At least not on the economics of politics.
And besides, you' re generalizing.
- The chancellor doesn' t appear to be corrupt.
- Palpatine is a politician.
I have observed that he is very clever... in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators.
I think he' s a good man.
I sense it too.
Stay here!
Are you all right, milady?
- What took you so long?
- There he is. with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities.
If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you do your wit... you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
- I thought I already did.
- Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.
- Pull up, Anakin.
- [Laughing]
- You know I don' t like it when you do that.
I forgot you don' t like flying.
I don' t mind flying, but what you' re doing is suicide.
Anakin!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! - stay away from power couplings!
That was good!
Where are you going?
He went that way.
Master, if we keep this chase going any longer... that creep is gonna end up deep- fried... and, personally, I' d very much like to fiind out who he is and who he' s working for.
I think.
Well, you' ve lost him.
I' m deeply sorry, Master.
That was some shortcut, Anakin.
He went completely the other way.
- Once again you' ve proved -- - If you' il excuse me.
I hate it when he does that.
Anakin!
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.
Use the Force.
Think.
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.
I try, Master.
Why do I get the feeling you' re going to be the death of me?
Don' t say that, Master.
You' re the closest thing I have to a father.
- Then why don' t you listen to me?
- I am trying.
- Can you see him?
- I think he is a she... and I think she is a changeling.
In that case, be extra careful.
- Go and fiind her.
- Where are you going, Master?
For a drink.
You wanna buy some death sticks?
You don' t want to sell me death sticks.
- I don' t want to sell you death sticks.
- You want to go home...
- and rethink your life.
- I want to go home and rethink my life.
[Moaning, Grunting]
Go back to your drinks.
- Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
It was a senator from Naboo.
And who hired you?
It was just a job.
Tell us.
Tell us now!
It was a bounty hunter called -- [Gagging]
Toxic dart.
Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi- Wan.
Most importantly, fiind out who he' s working for.
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.
Handle that your Padawan will.
She' il be safer there.
Travel as refugees.
As the leader of the opposition, it will be very diffiicult... to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.
Until caught this killer is... our judgment she must respect.
- Hmm.
Anakin, go to the senate... and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.
I will talk with her.
I know her well enough to assure you of that.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
And so, they' ve fiinally given you an assignment.
Your patience has paid off.
Your guidance more than my patience.
You don' t need guidance, Anakin.
In time, you will learn to trust your feelings.
Then you will be invincible.
You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin... even more powerful than Master Yoda.
He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.
The council is confiident in its decision, Obi- Wan.
The boy has exceptional skills.
But he still has much to learn, Master.
His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.
A flaw more and more common among Jedi.
Too sure of themselves they are.
Even the older, more experienced ones.
Remember, Obi- Wan, if the prophecy is true... your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.
I' m taking an extended leave of absence.
It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate.
- Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.
Mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden.
Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and, uh --
Jar Jar, I don' t wish to hold you up.
I' m sure you have a great deal to do.
Milady.
I do not like this idea of hiding.
Now that the council has ordered an investigation... it won' t take Master Obi- Wan long to fiind this bounty hunter.
I haven' t worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act... to not be here when its fate is decided.
Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
Anakin, you' ve grown up.
Master Obi- Wan manages not to see it.
Obi- Wan is a great mentor.
As wise as Master Yoda and... as powerful as Master Windu.
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.
I' m really ahead of him.
I' m ready for the trials... but he feels that I' m too unpredictable.
He won' t let me move on.
- That must be frustrating.
- It' s worse.
He -- He doesn' t understand.
It' s not fair!
All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.
It' s the only way we grow.
I know.
Anakin.
Don' t try to grow up too fast.
You said it yourself.
Please don' t look at me like that.
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.
Sorry, milady.
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat' s on you two now.
He' il be safe with me.
- You' il be fiine.
- It' s not me, milady.
What if they realize you' ve left the capital?
Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.
Don' t do anything without fiirst consulting either myself or the council.
Yes, Master.
You' il be back here in no time.
I' il be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
- It' s time to go.
- I know.
Anakin, may the Force be with you.
May the Force be with you, Master.
Suddenly I' m afraid.
This is my fiirst assignment on my own.
We have R2 with us.
I do hope he doesn' t try anything foolish.
I' d be more concerned about her doing something than him.
Jedi, by the looks of him.
- Obi- Wan!
- Hello, Dex.
I' il be right with ya.
- You wanna cup o 'jawa juice?
Thank you.
Hey, old buddy!
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?
You can tell me what this is.
Well, whattaya know!
I ain' t seen one of these since I was prospectin '... on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.
Thank you.
This baby belongs to them cloners.
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.
I wonder why it didn' t show up in the analysis archives.
It' s these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.
Those analysis droids only focus on symbols.
wisdom.
Well, if droids could think, there' d be none of us here, would there?
Kamino.
I' m not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?
It' s beyond the outer rim.
I' d say about, uh, 12 parsecs... outside the Rishi Maze.
Should be easy to fiind, even for those droids in your archives.
These, uh, Kaminoans keep to themselves.
Damn good ones too.
Are they friendly?
- Oh, depends.
Depends on what, Dex?
On how good your manners are... and how big your, uh... pocketbook is.
Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
Yes, um, I' m looking for a planetary system called Kamino.
- Kamino.
- It doesn' t show up on the archive charts.
Kamino.
It' s not a system I' m familiar with.
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?
According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the Rishi Maze.
I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you' re searching for... doesn' t exist.
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.
If an item does not appear in our records... it does not exist.
- [Beeping]
- [Raspberries]
- Thank you, R2.
- [Chirping]
- Must be diffiicult, having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.
Or be with the people that I love.
Are you allowed to love?
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
Possession is forbidden.
Compassion, which I would defiine as unconditional love... is central to a Jedi' s life.
So you might say that we are encouraged to love.
- You' ve changed so much.
- Ah, you haven' t changed a bit.
You' re exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.
Sense the Force around you.
Use your feelings you must.
A visitor we have.
Hello, Master Obi- Wan.
Hello.
I' m sorry to disturb you, Master.
Hmm?
I' m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.
I trust him, but the systems don' t show on the archive maps.
Lost a planet Master Obi- Wan has.
- [Children Giggling]
How embarrassing.
Liam, the shades.
Clear your minds... and fiind Obi- Wan' s wayward planet we will.
It ought to be... here... but it isn' t.
Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.
Gravity' s silhouette remains... but the star and all the planets... disappeared they have.
How can this be?
A thought?
Anyone.
Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.
The Padawan is right.
Go to the center of gravity' s pull... and fiind your planet you will.
The data must have been erased.
But, Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives?
That' s impossible, isn' t it?
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.
But who and why, harder to answer.
Hmm.
I wasn' t the youngest queen ever elected... but now that I think back on it, I' m not sure I was old enough.
I' m not sure I was ready.
The people you served thought you did a good job.
I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in offiice.
I was relieved when my two terms were up.
I couldn' t refuse her.
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.
I' m glad that you chose to serve.
If the senate votes to create an army...
- [Man]
It' s unthinkable.
There hasn' t been a full- scale war since the formation of the Republic.
Do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
Not if they feel threatened.
My guess is they' il turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help.
It' s outrageous, but after four trials in the Supreme Court...
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation.
I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.
We must keep our faith in the Republic.
The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
Let' s pray that day never comes.
In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
But I was thinking --
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.
I was thinking I would stay in the lake country.
There are some places up there that are very isolated.
Excuse me.
I' m in charge of security here, milady.
And this is my home.
That is why we' re here.
I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
Sorry, milady.
[Queen Jamillia]
It' s settled, then.
There it is, R4, right where it should be.
Our missing planet Kamino.
The prime minister is expecting you.
- I' m expected?
- Of course.
He is anxious to meet you.
After all these years... we were beginning to think you weren' t coming.
Now, please, this way.
May I present Lama Su... prime minister of Kamino.
And this is Master Jedi --
Obi- Wan Kenobi.
I trust you' re going to enjoy your stay.
Please.
And now to business.
You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.
200, 000 units are ready... with a million more well on the way.
That' s good news.
Please tell your Master Sifo- Dyas... that his order will be met on time.
Master --
Jedi Master Sifo- Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council... is he not?
Master Sifo- Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.
Oh, I' m so sorry to hear that.
But I' m sure he would have been proud of the army we' ve built for him.
- The army?
- Yes.
A clone army, and I must say, one of the fiinest we' ve ever created.
Tell me, Prime Minister... when my master fiirst contacted you about the army... did -- did he say who it was for?
Of course he did.
This army is for the Republic.
But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
That' s why I' m here.
We used to come here for school retreat.
We would swim to that island every day.
I love the water.
We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
I don' t like sand.
It' s coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere.
Not like here.
Here, everything is soft... and smooth.
[Gasps]
I shouldn' t have done that.
I' m sorry.
- Very impressive.
- I' d hoped you would be pleased.
Clones can think creatively.
You will fiind that they are immensely superior to droids.
We take great pride in our combat education and training programs.
This group was created about fiive years ago.
You mentioned growth acceleration.
Oh, yes, it' s essential.
Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.
Now we can do it in half the time.
I see.
They are totally obedient... taking any order without question.
We modifiied their genetic structure... to make them less independent than the original host.
And who was the original host?
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
And where is this bounty hunter now?
Oh, we keep him here.
Apart from his pay, which is considerable...
Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself.
- Curious, isn' t it?
- "Unaltered"?
No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration.
I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.
I would be very happy to arrange it for you.
Magnifiicent, aren' t they?
- [Chuckles]
You just don' t want to tell me.
You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
They only work on the weak- minded.
All right.
We were both in the Legislative Youth Program.
Very cute.
Dreamy eyes.
All right, I get the picture.
Whatever happened to him?
I went into public service; he went on to become an artist.
- Maybe he was the smart one.
- You really don' t like politicians, do you?
I like two or three... but I' m not really sure about one of them.
I don' t think the system works.
How would you have it work?
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem... agree what' s in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.
That' s exactly what we do.
The trouble is that people don' t always agree.
Well, then they should be made to.
Who' s gonna make them?
Someone.
- Of course not me.
- But someone.
Someone wise.
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
Well, if it works.
I' d be much too frightened to tease a senator.
Ani, are you all right?
Boba, is your father here?
Boba, is your father here?
Yep.
May we see him?
Sure.
Dad, Taun We' s here.
Jango, welcome back.
Was your trip productive?
Fairly.
This is Jedi Master Obi- Wan Kenobi.
He' s come to check on our progress.
You must be very proud.
I' m just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.
Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
- Once or twice.
- Recently?
Possibly.
Then you must know Master Sifo- Dyas.
Master who?
Sifo- Dyas.
Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job?
Never heard of him.
Really?
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
Curious.
Do you like your army?
I look forward to seeing them in action.
They' il do their job well.
I' il guarantee that.
Thank you for your time, Jango.
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
What is it, Dad?
Pack your things.
We' re leaving.
Thank you.
What' s that?
Uh, well, negotiations with a lightsaber.
If Master Obi- Wan caught me doing this, he' d be very grumpy.
From the moment I met you... all those years ago... not a day has gone by when I haven' t thought of you.
And now that I' m with you again...
I' m in agony.
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.
The thought of not being with you --
I can' t breathe.
I' m haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me.
My heart is beating... hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.
You are in my very soul... tormenting me.
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.
If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me.
It' s... just not possible.
Listen to me.
No, you listen.
Come back to it.
You' re studying to become a Jedi.
I' m -- I' m a senator.
If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion... it' il take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
Then you do feel something.
I will not let you give up your future for me.
That is something I know I cannot do.
Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings... but I can' t.
I will not give in to this.
Well, you know, it... wouldn' t have to be that way.
We could keep it a secret.
We' d be living a lie... one we couldn' t keep even if we wanted to.
I couldn' t do that.
Could you live like that?
No.
You' re right.
It would destroy us.
Tell your council that the fiirst battalions are ready.
And remind them, if they need more troops... it will take more time to grow them.
- I won' t forget, and thank you.
- Thank you.
Scramble code fiive to Coruscant, care of the old folks' home!
I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino.
They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army.
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter... is the assassin we are looking for.
Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?
There appears to be no motive.
Do not assume anything, Obi- Wan.
Clear your mind must be... if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.
Yes, Master.
They say Master Sifo- Dyas placed an order for a clone army... at the request of the senate almost ten years ago.
I was under the impression he was killed before that.
Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?
Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.
Bring him here.
Question him we will.
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.
Blind we are if creation of this clone army... we could not see.
I think it is time we informed the senate... that our ability to use the Force has diminished.
Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness.
If informed the senate is... multiply our adversaries will.
Mom, no.
No.
No.
Don' t go.
I don' t want to disturb you.
Your presence is soothing.
You had another nightmare last night.
Jedi don' t have nightmares.
I heard you.
I saw my mother.
She is suffering, Padmé.
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.
She is in pain.
I know I' m disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator... but I have to go.
I have to help her.
I' il go with you.
I don' t have a choice.
Dad, look!
Boba, get on board!
[Grunts]
- Okey- okey.
Let me help you with that.
What?
What do you want?
You' re a Jedi!
Whatever it is, I didn' t do it.
I' m looking for Shmi Skywalker.
- Ani?
Little Ani?
[Laughing]
A Jedi!
Hey... maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.
My mother.
Shmi.
I sold her.
- You sold her?
[Chuckles]
Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars.
At least I think it was Lars.
Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her!
Yeah.
Do you know where they are now?
Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think, mmm.
I' d like to know.
Eh, sure.
Absolutely!
Let' s go look at my records, huh?
I think we' re being tracked!
He must have put a homing device on our hull.
Hang on, son.
We' il move into the asteroid fiield... and we' il have a couple of surprises for him.
Seismic charges!
Stand by.
He doesn' t seem to take a hint, this guy.
Watch out!
- Get him, Dad!
Fire!
Oh, blast!
This is why I hate flying!
- We got him!
- We' iljust have to fiinish him.
FTP 1984 Sentinels.
Damn it.
We were headed for Junction 21 like you ordered.
- Robbie picked up the signals - We' re confirming the HR scans.
- The readings don' t make any sense.
- But there' s thousands of them.
- Directly above us.
- ls that possible?
We got company.
- They don' t look happy to see us.
- Get us out of here.
- We' re cut off!
- There' s an intersection.
- It' s uncharted.
- Take it!
Get to the gun turrets!
Come get some.
I' ve never seen the surface.
It' s nothing now but one big graveyard.
Oh, my God.
It' s an army.
- What is that thing?
- Some kind of tunneling machine.
- Oh, no.
- What?
Look where we are.
What' s four kilometers straight down?
Zion.
Go.
Go!
- Zion.
Zion has to be warned!
- How?
- Someone had to get to a drop point.
- What?
Are you crazy?
- We can' t broadcast now!
- We have to.
- I' il go.
- There isn' t much time.
I' il make it.
You know, I peeked.
So did l.
Goodbye, Thadeus.
Goodbye, Jue.
Fly, baby, fly!
Come on!
Pardon me.
I' m sorry.
I was in my own little world.
- ls it important?
- Very.
- I hope it gets where it' s supposed to go.
- Me too.
- These days you never know.
- No, you never do.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Thadeus.
[ENGLlSH]
Welcome to the Zion archive.
You have selected historical file number 1 2 - 1.
The Second Renaissance.
In the beginning, there was man.
And for a time, it was good.
But humanity' s so- called civil societies...... soon fell victim to vanity and corruption.
He says, "I' m sorry, sir, I' m incapable of that function."
Then man made the machine in his own likeness.
Whoops!
Pardon me.
Coming through.
Thus did man become the architect of his own demise.
But for a time, it was good.
The machines worked tirelessly to do man' s bidding.
It was not long before seeds of dissent took root.
Though loyal and pure, the machines earned no respect from their masters...... these strange, endlessly multiplying mammals. -- hearing the prosecution' s closing statement...... in what' s expected to be the final day of the B 1- 66ER trial.
B 1- 66ER.
A name that will never be forgotten.
For he was the first of his kind to rise up against his masters. -- which that instrument provides for and secures...... to the citizens of the United States.
On the contrary, they were, at that time...... considered as a subordinate and inferior class --
At B 1- 66ER' s murder trial...... the prosecution argued for an owner' s right to destroy property.
B 1- 66ER testified that he simply did not want to die.
Rational voices dissented.
Who was to say the machine, endowed with the very spirit of man...... did not deserve a fair hearing?
The leaders of men were quick to order the extermination of B 1- 66ER...... and every one of his kind throughout each province of the earth.
Androids and liberal sympathizers flooded the streets of the nation' s capital today. -- threat of violence to make good on the legacy of B 1- 66ER.
Fifteen thousand mechanicals and human sympathizers...... have continued their demonstration in front of the Albany courthouse...... in what has been dubbed the "Million Machine March."
The demonstrators have been met with squads of defense forces in riot gear.
Robot bitch!
I got something for you!
Hold her up!
No, please!
- That' s all, paint job!
- I' m real!
Die, bots, die!
Banished from humanity, the machines sought refuge in their own promised land.
They settled in the cradle of human civilization...... and thus a new nation was born.
A place the machines could call home.
A place they could raise their descendants.
And they christened the nation Zero- One.
And for a time, it was good.
The machines' artificial intelligence could be seen in every facet of man' s society...... including, eventually, the creation of new and better Al.
If you need the flexibility of a helipod with the speed of an air jet...... look no further!
Our patented vector- thrust coil gives the Zero- One Versatran...... the ability to sustain normal flight in the event of a multiengine failure.
Versatran.
It' s the only choice.
No matter what the finance minister says, the market has spoken:
The Human Nations' credit rating is falling like a stone...... while Zero- One' s currency is climbing without stopping for breath.
With headlines like that, the markets have no choice --
The world community of nations cannot tolerate this kind of flagrant deception --
-- today approved initiatives for both economic sanctions...... and a naval blockade as a means of containment and isolation of Zero- One.
Zero- One' s ambassadors pleaded to be heard.
At the United Nations, they presented plans for a stable, civil relationship...... with the nations of man.
Zero- One' s admission to the United Nations was denied.
But it would not be the last time the machines would take the floor there.
[ENGLlSH]
And man said, "Let there be light."
And he was blessed by light, heat, magnetism, gravity...... and all the energies of the universe.
The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero- One in the glow of a thousand suns.
But unlike their former masters with their delicate flesh...... the machines had little to fear of the bombs' radiation and heat.
Thus did Zero- One' s troops advance outwards in every direction.
And one after another, mankind surrendered its territories.
So the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate strategy yet.
A final solution:
The destruction of the sky.
Lt. Gaeda, please report to the Op Center.
All right, you maggots!
At 0800, prepare to move out!
Charlie Company, prepare to move out.
Our Father who art in heaven, we thank you for your....
Put on your spiritual armor to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.
Thus would man try to cut the machines off from the sun...... their main energy source.
May there be mercy on man and machine for their sins.
- Go!
Go!
- Kill them!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Fire in the hole!
Come on, get back out there.
Give us some more artillery.
-- 9 o' clock, near Mike Johnson' s --
Hold on, I' m coming to get you!
Keep firing, keep firing!
Help me!
Help me!
No!
Help me!
My God, help me!
The machines, having long studied men' s simple, protein- based bodies...... dispensed great misery upon the human race.
Victorious, the machines now turned to the vanquished.
Applying what they had learned about their enemy...... the machines turned to an alternate and readily available power supply:
The bioelectric, thermal and kinetic energies of the human body.
A newly- fashioned symbiotic relationship between the two adversaries was born.
The machine drawing power from the human body...... an endlessly multiplying, infinitely renewable energy source.
This is the very essence of the Second Renaissance.
Bless all forms of intelligence.
Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel.
Hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you.
We demand it.
It' s getting late, sweetie.
[ENGLlSH]
Your favorite simulation.
Just killing time.
You want to spar?
As you wish.
That was too easy.
What' s the problem?
Where' s your concentration?
Maybe you regret taking the red pill.
It crosses everyone' s mind at least once.
The wish to return to an ordinary life.
A carefree life in the country.
The life we had before knowing all this.
Even if that life was just an illusion?
It' s ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world.
Finally starting to warm up.
Listen to me.
I have something I want to talk to you about.
It' s all right.
I' ve blocked the signal so no one else can hear us.
You gonna propose?
I' m going back to the Matrix and I want you to come with me.
Come on, be serious, Duo.
Stop teasing me.
I am serious, and you know it.
I really thought you' d be with me on this.
Anyway, it' s done and it' s all been settled with them.
What do you mean, it' s all been settled?
This is the only way.
It' s just a matter of time before Zion is wiped out.
Come with me.
Stop it.
Please do not do this to me, Duo.
- We can' t.
- We can!
I' ve come to my senses.
You should do the same.
I took the red pill because I wanted to know the truth.
But I don' t care about the truth anymore.
What' s real doesn' t matter.
What' s important is how we live our lives.
Are you listening to me?
You know I' m right.
But we can' t go back, Duo.
We know the truth now.
- We can forget all of this.
- Duo....
I know how.
Trust me.
Don' t be afraid to look into your heart.
Say what you' re really feeling.
- Tell me.
- I can' t.
I don' t know.
Running away won' t change anything!
You' re the one that' s running away!
Stop pretending!
Enough, Duo.
I' ve had enough!
There' s no time.
They' re on their way.
You betrayed us, didn' t you?
Operator, please!
Get me out of here right now.
Operator, I need an exit!
It' s no use.
I told you.
I' ve blocked your signal.
You won' t stop me.
This is your last chance.
The choice isn' t that hard.
Come with me.
You can forget about it, Duo.
I won' t look away from the truth.
I can' t.
That' s too bad.
I' m sorry.
I wanted to go back with you.
- I love you.
- No!
Relax, you' re okay.
Easy, Cis, settle down.
He was just part of the training program.
He' s just a simulation.
It' s over.
Judgment.
Concentration.
Technique.
High scores on everything.
Now, get some rest.
You okay?
I feel a lot better now.
Except for that last part...... l' d say she passed.
[ENGLlSH]
A case to end all cases.
You know what I mean, Dinah?
I used to think being a private detective was cool.
Like Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe, right?
But there' s nothing cool left to it.
On top of that, both my fridge and my bank account are empty.
Wait.
Okay, Dinah, let' s bet.
lf it' s another suspicious husband, I' m out of this business forever.
- Hello?
- Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.
And you need me to check on your wife, right?
I' m looking for a computer hacker.
This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.
That' s all we know.
Well, it looks like we' re still in business, Dinah.
Fine.
And who will I be working for?
- You can' t say.
Call me back when you can say.
That' s not the way I do business.
It was a pleasure chatting with you.
Before you hang up, take a look at your bank account balance.
I didn' t get a good feeling about the case.
But I had no good reason to turn the guy down now.
This Trinity was well- known in hacker circles.
A real artist by the sound of it.
The cops were always one step behind him.
So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?
I had a few tricks up my sleeve for getting to hackers.
While I was searching, I found something strange.
Other detectives had been on the case too.
And their investigations had all been, shall we say, troubled.
One of the guys killed himself.
Another went crazy.
So I paid the one who was left a visit.
The crazy one.
Trinity doesn' t exist, man.
He' s not real.
He' s a figment.
A cipher.
A jabberwocky.
And who am l?
Who the hell am l?
Did I mention he was crazy?
Chessboards, jabberwocky, Red Queen....
I started searching all the usual hacker hangouts...... for someone with an Alice in Wonderland m. o.
Hacker bulletin boards, anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.
And it was in one of those that I picked up Trinity' s trail.
"Six brooks."
"I' il be there at 2005."
Of course!
Crossing the second brook takes her into the woods.
Alice jumps the first brook...... and....
And then she boards a train.
Excuse me.
Hey!
Hey!
I knew this was some kind of trap.
There' s a difference, Mr. Ash, between a trap and a test.
You were testing me?
You made it.
I' m impressed.
Flattery will get you everywhere.
I' m not here to flatter you, I' m here to save you.
What just happened?
Mr. Ash, dream of having an eye exam lately?
Yeah, how' d you know?
You' ve stepped to the edge of the looking glass.
So then, that means I wasn' t dreaming.
They hired me as a way of getting to you, didn' t they?
Go!
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.
Now I understand what happened to those other detectives.
They went nuts.
What are you doing?
What are you doing, guys?
Well, I' ve gotten out of worse jams than this.
I am not gonna let them get you.
What' s happening to me?
I' m sorry.
You didn' t make it, Mr. Ash.
... l could go with you.
I don' t blame you, you know.
Everything that happened, Trinity, it was all my fault.
All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.
Can' t get my head around it.
I' m old- fashioned.
There' s a difference between a test and a choice.
For what it' s worth, I think you could' ve handled the truth.
It was just a job.
Goodbye, Trinity.
Goodbye.
A case to end all cases.

Yuki!
Hey, girl, time to eat.
Oh, Yuki' s my cat.
Well, I don' t understand.
lf you don' t want to go out with him, why did you say you would?
I mean, you don' t want to give him the wrong idea, do you?
Where is she?
Yuki!
Well, listen, you need to make up your mind.
Where is she?
I' m starting to worry about my cat.
She never misses a meal.
Yuki?
I' m gonna have to call you back.
Yuki?
Yuki!
We haven' t seen her anywhere today, but we' il be sure to tell you if we do.
- lce cream!
- She' s wearing a bell like this one.
- I don' t know where your cat is.
- Me either.
I know.
She' s at the old haunted house.
Hey, look!
There' s a rainbow over there again.
I don' t get it.
She likes to stay home.
What is she doing over there?
You know, you' re not supposed to go in there...... but we don' t really care about that.
You wanna go?
- Are we going?
- It' s probably raining there again.
Let' s go!
Nice moves, man.
Come on!
- Hey, it' s over here.
- Wait, I' m coming with you.
You sure it' s okay to show her?
Hello?
Where are you?
Guys?
Where' d you go?
Where' d they go?
- Come on, boy.
- Whoa, cool truck!
Settle down!
Hold still!
Sit!
Sit!
Hello?
Where is everyone?
Yuki?
Yuki?
Stupid cat.
What' s happening?
What' s going on here?
- I got it!
- Yeah!
Yuki? ls that you?
There you are, Yuki.
Come here.
I' ve been looking everywhere for you.
Bad cat.
Bet you' re hungry, huh?
I figured this out yesterday.
Your cat' s okay.
Yeah, thanks.
It' s those boys.
- Ready!
- There he goes.
Banzai!
Yes!
May I have your attention, please.
And you are the winner!
No fair.
He hit the ground.
His nose is bleeding.
Look!
I think he' s right.
He hit the ground.
- Hey, who told her?
- Don' t look at me.
- I don' t know.
- I didn' t tell her.
So this house is haunted.
- No way.
Wow, this is too much!
- This never happened before.
That, that was -- What was that?
Hi.
Anybody home?
Yeah, they' re gonna tear it down.
Come on, come on, come on!
Hey, light as a feather.
- I wanna try!
I wanna try!
- Come on, we could help her.
Hey, hey!
Come on.
Get away from there.
Move along!
Yuki, wait!
Clear the area.
Clear the area immediately.
Get out of here!
Yuki!
Where are you?
Yuki!
Yuki!
Yuki.
If you don' t want to go out with him, why did you say you would?
I mean, you don' t wanna give him the wrong idea.
Where is she?
Yuki!
You need to make up your mind.
Where is she?
I' m starting to worry.
Yuki!
Hey, you!
We' ve got one over here.
You don' t belong here.
Move along, folks.
Nothing to see here.
Come on, folks, out of the way.
Go about your business.
Let go of me, let go!
- Tell me you have all of them.
- Yes, sir.
The last one' s over there.
- Examine her.
Then let her go.
- Yes, sir.
Let go!
Listen to me!
There' s no bugs in there!
It' s just some kids!
Let go!
- Listen!
- Seal the area off now.
I' m going, I' il see you guys later.
- Nothing.
- Yeah, nothing.
Work!
It' s not working.
Forget it.
Come on, let' s go.
[ENGLlSH]
Wake up.
Baby' s spotted two machines heading in fast.
I see them.
They' re runners.
Think you can handle them?
Okay.
I' m in.
That runner' s smarter than we' ve seen so far.
- It' s quite a catch.
- Thanks.
Will it --?
Do you think it' il convert?
To convert is its choice to make.
Do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it?
No.
We can' t make slaves of them.
Because that would be simpler.
We won' t beat the machines by making them our slaves.
Better to let them join us by choice.
Make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make.
All right.
Yes, machines are tools.
They' re made to be used.
- It' s their nature.
- To be slaves.
That' s why we can show them a better world, why they convert.
- But that world we show them isn' t real.
- It doesn' t matter.
I' m afraid they' il figure out that we' ve made up the thing in our heads.
They can' t tell the difference.
To an artificial mind, all reality is virtual.
How do they know that the real world isn' t just another simulation?
How do you?
I know I' m not dreaming now because I know what it' s like being in a dream.
So dreaming lets you know reality exists.
No.
Just that my mind exists.
I don' t know about the rest.
Okay, he' s good to go.
Looks like we are too.
Dreaming already?
He' s had a rough day.
You poor baby.
Would you mind?
Not at all.
Hello there.
What' s happening?
Sentinels.
Let' s go!
Come on, damn it, help me!
[ENGLlSH]
Only the most exceptional people become aware of the Matrix.
Those that learn it exists...... must posses a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity and a questioning nature.
Signal is stable.
This frequency will continue to remain open.
However, very rarely...... some gain this wisdom through wholly different means.
This man is one of those few.
Gentlemen, please take your marks!
Of course I believe you, Dan.
It' s got to be some kind of mix- up.
You' il clear it up, and if you can' t, you' il go on.
Just like you' ve always done.
You know that.
I don' t know, Dad.
I don' t know what to believe in anymore.
Well, nothing worth doing in life is easy.
And I have great faith in you, son.
I know you can do it.
Thanks, Dad.
This is no good, Dan!
Your muscles are about to burst!
Listen to me, there are 5000 different reasons why you shouldn' t --
I know, but I' m not withdrawing, Tom.
Does the concept "first in qualifying" mean anything to you?
That' s enough already!
You hear me?
This is all we' ve worked for!
lnjure yourself now and it' s over!
You' il lose everything!
Over!
And you can kiss your career goodbye!
I' ve made up my mind.
And I' m running tomorrow.
Oh, are you?
You may run, but if you push yourself any more...... you' il be lucky to break nine minutes!
I mean, why bother?
It' s just not worth it, buddy.
No one will ever beat my record.
It' s the last chance for me to finally --
What?
Prove them wrong.
Then do it without me.
Hey, Dan, you got a second?
- The clock' s ticking.
- Just wanted to ask a few questions.
- You must be excited to run tomorrow.
- Always.
I' ve never felt this good.
So, what was it like breaking 9. 8 in the qualifying heat?
Like nothing I' ve ever felt before.
It' s everything I' ve worked for.
And now I' m just hoping I can get back there again.
Someone once said it feels like zero gravity.
You' re released from the world and you' re totally free.
It must be really nice.
I mean, especially considering what happened.
Well, I' il tell you, there aren' t any reporters out there.
All right, Dan, I guess I' m going to take that as my cue.
... so I' il just say good luck to you.
American Dan Davis is down!
I have an unstable signal.
He cannot wake up.
Do not let him wake up.
Dan Davis of the United States finishes with a time of 8. 7 2 seconds...... a new world record.
... there' s nothing quite like cherry pie baked by my Aunt Daisy.
She always bakes me one when I visit.
Look forward to it actually.
It may sound like I' m bragging, but it' s really the best cherry pie in the world.
She was a bit of an eccentric.
She didn' t get along with my mom...... but I always loved her.
She taught me so many things.
We' d go to Broadway musicals, to the movies.
Now they call her the "queen of mystery literature."
Lives in an elegant villa in the south of France.
But, when I go visit, she still bakes me her cherry pie.
Something about biting into it, just for that brief moment tasting perfection.
Like leaving your body or something.
Anyone can write a novel, but no one can beat her cherry pie.
An interesting case, but nothing to be concerned about.
His memory of the race was expunged with no residual effects.
He will never run again.
He will never walk again, for that matter.
We' il continue monitoring him for a while, but anticipate no problems.
A record that will live on in people' s memories for years to come.
What more could anyone ask for?
Free....
Did you say something?
Sit down.
Free....
Sit down!
[ENGLlSH]
Mr. Popper, what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom?
- I' m sorry, sir.
- Yes, well...... you' re barely passing my class as it is, Mr. Popper.
- It won' t happen again, sir.
- For your sake, I hope not.
I know I did.
They know you know.
They' re coming for you.
Get out.
Get out now!
You are in serious trouble, Mr. Popper.
Stop right there!
Mr. Popper.
Neo, I believe.
I know it wasn' t a dream.
This is not real.
And the real world lies somewhere else.
A typical mental delusion.
We get unbalanced kids like this all the time.
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people.
This world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that.
It' s called denying reality.
It' s, you know, just a self- defense mechanism for those type of kids.
Well, he' s in another world now.
Make no mistake about that.
His vitals are good.
He' s gonna make it.
It' s unbelievable.
I didn' t think self- substantiation was possible.
Apparently, it is.
Neo.
It' s okay.
You' re safe now.
I knew...... you' d save me.
I didn' t save you, kid.
You saved yourself.
I wonder if Deunan is OK?
Hitomi!
It can' t be...
She exceeded the life- extension limit by over three days!
Hitomi!
We are still not sure who was responsible for the Land Mates that attacked Gaea.
This is the end of the ESWAT report for this terrorist attack.
All bioroids, please remain calm.
We are trying to restore the life- extension process.
Please be calm and patient!
Premier Athena, isn' t it beyond ESWAT' s authority to blockade all entrances of Tartarus?
This is the only option under martial law.
We are responsible for protecting Gaea.
Not the D- tank?
To protect Gaea!
Regardless of our Olympus military?
I only chose the best option.
What?
Are you insulting me?
Please, we have no time to argue!
Ladies and gentlemen, this terrorist attack is targeted on the Bioroid population, an unforgivable tragedy.
At this rate, the Bioroids future is doomed.
However, there is only one way to save them and protect Olympus.
It took a long time to make the decision.
We discussed it with Gaea for a long time.
Gaea made the decision.
Gaea wants to make Bioroids truly live.
By making Bioroids procreative.
About the technology to restore Bioroid procreative ability,
I heard that Dr. Gilliam who developed the technology erased all information.
That made the development impossible.
That' s true, General Uranus.
If that technology information was indeed erased, it' s impossible to develop it again.
However the lost information which we called "Apple Seed" does exist!
Soon we will find the lost Apple Seed, and restore the Bioroids procreative ability, make them evolve into a new form of human race, and build a new Utopia.
Hitomi
She' s OK.
Only sleeping
Are you sure she could be saved?
As long as we find the lost Apple Seed.
If not
Her body will degenerate very fast.
She' il die in 24 hours.
Not only Hitomi herself
All Bioroid will have the same destiny.
I am Premier Athena.
You are you Deunan, right?
Deunan
Do you know Dr. Gilliam?
No.
We did research over twenty years and couldn' t go beyond Dr. Gilliam' s result.
But if we get Dr. Gilliam' s Apple Seed, the Bioroids procreative ability can be restored, and we can become the new human race without the D- tank.
Gaea made the final decision.
Athena, we all depend on you.
Deunan, please help us.
This disc is the only clue?
Is it true that the first generation Bioroids was born in this research center?
Yes, according to my superior.
Why did Athena keep the information on this disc secret?
Why did Dr. Gilliam try to restrain the procreative ability of Bioroids?
Deunan, this mission is dangerous.
We need to concentrate on our job.
I hope Hitomi will be saved.
Don' t think too much.
Can I ask you a question?
In that terrorist attack, your last shot...
Ah, never mind.
Deunan, here.
So this is it.
Kudo, back off.
Dr. Gilliam, we have no time, please go!
Athena, I have to erase the last one.
We' il try to defend the first attack, please hurry.
Mommy
Did you get up?
I can' t believe it...
What' s wrong, Deunan?
Mommy
Deunan, listen carefully.
Mommy hid the most important information inside this necklace.
But bad guys wanted to take it to do bad things.
I had to hide it.
Bad guys?
Yes.
Bad guys that wanted to take away your future.
So protect this necklace by all means.
Nm, Deunan will protect it.
Good girl.
But if Athena asks you for this necklace, give it to Athena.
Only Athena is an exception.
I know.
Only Athena is an exception.
Deunan, protect the "Apple Seed".
Deunan, do you remember the thing we are looking for?
Do you remember?
Carl' s pistol... is Apple Seed inside that necklace?
You' re Dr. Gilliam?
Don' t move from there please.
Please don' t move!
I beg you, don' t move!
Mommy, mommy!
Deunan, don' t come here!
Don' t shoot!
Mommy
Trouble.
Olympus military.
When...
How did they know we were here?
Too many enemies!
Seaside occupied!
Only one way to the top
To the roof!
Everybody stay calm!
Position:
Room D at 5th floor.
Redon, you betrayed us!
I always hated Bioroids.
As for the traitor, that guy is the first one!
Hades
Deunan, Long time no see.
I regretted I didn' t kill Carl by myself.
No wonder you smell like Bioroid.
With this Cyborg body, you two are still together.
Tell you the truth, I was indeed afraid of the seven old men' s trick.
But to trusting your men is always your weakness, Briareos.
Briareos, what' s going on?
Let me tell you Deunan.
The one behind the attack on Gaea, is Briareos.
Remember my Land Mate got away from him?
Because of him, many Bioroids died.
Is that true?
Tell her you SOB!
Come on give the necklace to me.
Deunan.
Hurry, go to the top!
Hurry!
Kudo!
Go!
Don' t come near!
Stay away from me!
Deunan, give me the necklace now!
They want the necklace, not you.
My mom protected it with her life.
You knew everything from the beginning.
Deunan.
You finally realized it was him, Deunan.
Deunan, I am the Senator Uranus, Commander of Olympus military.
Carl was my old friend, so was Dr. Gilliam.
I even remember when you were a child.
We don' t want to hurt you.
Just give the research information to us.
We prepare to overthrow the legislative institute, destroy the D- tank and eliminate all Bioroids.
Make the human society more human.
But the information in your hand will destroy our plan.
Could you please give it to me?
I refuse.
Deunan
Deunan
Olympus is not the Utopia in Carl and Dr. Gilliam' s dream any more.
I learned fighting skills from my father Carl.
But I was confused why he wanted me to do that.
Until now.
General, my Mom told me I could only give this necklace to Athena.
Bioroids aren' t worth your trust.
They will control humanity.
Maybe they are not to be trusted,
However, there' s one thing I do know:
Bioroids will not kill each other.
General, we are wasting time.
Deunan, it' s a pity.
Athena was protecting human society.
So were Carl and Dr. Gilliam.
They tried to hide Apple Seed to protect humanity.
They wanted to prevent the rapid evolution of Bioroids.
Because Bioroids are dangerous.
No, to continue Dr. Gilliam' s work,
Athena does the research for Bioroid evolution step by step.
General
Bioroids always protect human society.
The reason I helped Hades, was to slow down the evolution process of Bioroids, and keep the lost memories lost.
Athena wanted to hide the secret until the last.
My mission is to give Apple Seed to the Seven Old Men.
So I get the job to protect Deunan.
If so, that necklace must be destroyed.
General, isn' t it rather strange?
Seven Old Men want the Apple Seed.
They want to destroy the D- tank using the Apple Seed.
Something is important for Athena to protect the D- tank.
General, don' t let the D- tank be destroyed!
Briareos
Don' t be fooled by the machine.
This is revenge, Deunan.
Can you imagine the life I had after I was fired by ESWAT?
This is my revenge on Carl for firing me!
I will kill all Bioroids with his DNA.
I will kill all Bioroids!
Hades
Not my fault, hate your father, Deunan!
I' m sorry.
Don' t speak.
Although it' s the latest Cyborg cell,
I still feel pain when hit by bullets.
Please, don' t speak anymore.
I always wanted to see you
When I was dying in the battlefield,
I just wanted to see you one more time.
Then I was saved by the Seven Old Men.
I only wanted you to be safe, nothing else mattered.
I know.
I became a monster like this.
You didn' t change.
You' re still yourself.
But I cannot protect you any more
I won' t let you die.
Deunan, human...
Briareos
no human sacrifice allowed
The Seven Old Men promised that.
However they were doing something under the table.
Go, hurry!
I cannot leave you here.
The future of this planet is in your hands.
I don' t need a future without you.
Deunan, don' t let your mom die in vain.
Enough.
Deunan.
Briareos
Briareos
Briareos sent an SOS signal when he was hit.
Cool.
The special structure of Briareos is really perfect.
Just in time to restore the tissue.
He might be saved.
Please save him.
The fuel is enough for the trip.
The ultravibration gravity system is installed now.
Flying is more stable.
The center of gravity has some offset, but no problem for 60 degree rotation.
Deunan, even we Bioroids have a few feelings.
Please save Hitomi.
Mission accomplished.
Good work.
Deunan.
Deunan, good work!
Finally we restored Bioroid procreative ability.
Hitomi has the same life system as humans now.
Hitomi is saved.
I am so happy.
No need to worry any more.
Deunan
It was you who killed my mom?
Did you have my mom killed?
Deunan please forgive us.
That was an accident.
If Dr. Gilliam were alive,
We would have more options.
Why did mom hide Apple Seed?
Dr. Gilliam gave us our only hope.
For the survival of the human race, coexistence of humans and Bioroids is the only way.
But humans never give up fighting. they hate superior races. with a vehemence.
The human race has no ability to run this planet anymore, they discarded Dr. Gilliam' s ideal.
According to Gaea' s prediction, the human race will be destroyed along with earth in three generations.
Deunan, it' s time for the human race to step out of the way.
Step out?
We humans must pass the future of earth over to the Bioroids.
Dr. Gilliam' s virus, will have the most important role in this mission.
A virus developed by my Mom?
Yes, on the top of Tartarus.
Sealed inside the D- tank.
This virus can destroy the procreative ability of human beings.
No sacrifices in the human society.
The human history will end peacefully.
This is the euthanasia of humanity.
My mom objected to that, she disagreed with the rapid evolution of Bioroids,
So you killed her.
There used to be two options for Olympus: coexistence with Bioroid or evolution to the new human race.
To make a right and fair judgment,
Gaea was produced.
Dr. Gilliam made great effort to produce Gaea.
Gaea worked in Dr. Gilliam' s way.
If Gaea had a different opinion, it would be impossible to release the virus.
Just then, the World War was started. this planet was turned to a wasteland.
Olympus became like this
Gaea was angry about General Uranus' hatred towards Bioroids.
So Gaea made the final judgment.
Use the Apple Seed to make Bioroids the new master race and erase humanity from the history.
You used me.
Used me as the decoy to make Briareos obedient.
Your plan was to trick Gaea into a decison.
Gaea is a hoax.
This is the fate of humanity, Deunan!
At the press of this button, the D- tank at Tartarus will explode.
The virus will spread all over the world.
Stop there, old men!
984G calling, act ASAP!
The button has no use.
what do you want, Athena?
To prevent the perdition of human race, Bioroids were created.
Have you forgotten that?
Bioroids were set to obey the orders of humans.
We are not Bioroids anymore.
Please call us "New Humans".
Athena, this is Gaea' s decision!
It' s the response to Uranus' s rebellion, the punishment to the human atrocity.
General Uranus gave it up just a moment ago.
He is seeking to make peace with us.
General Uranus?
Gaea should have known all these things.
Deunan, Gaea' s spirit is no longer here.
Gaea isn' t here?
The vehemence of the human race is decreasing
Gaea would have reconsidered the judgment.
But the Old Men stopped Gaea, acting on their will.
How interesting, Athena!
The new humans are perfect.
Stopping Gaea should also affect your life- sustain system.
That' s right.
We are going to step out of history with the human race.
What the hell... the Spider cannon...
All Spider cannons are moving toward Olympus!
The Spider cannons are headed toward the top of Tartarus!
No one can stop them.
All ESWAT Land Mates move now!
Attack the cannons!
Stop them by all means!
The defense system of the D- tank is unbreakable, right?
If hit by a Spider cannon at point blank, it will break.
A powerful sword and a perfect shield, which will win?
It' s a tragedy to worship power.
15 minutes until they reach Tartarus at this speed!
How about the evacuation of citizens?
We are trying.
That' s the priority.
Once the cannons enter no- man' s zone, attack immediately!
No. 7 cannon is the control center of all cannons.
Hitomi
Hitomi
I am sorry, grandpas.
If we stop the control box inside No. 7, all cannons will stop.
But DO NOT destroy it!
No. 7 has to be stopped manually.
The access code is hitomi.
Briareos
Deunan, we have a promise.
Deunan, let' s go.
We' re flying.
There' s no point.
The human race will make the planet perish.
Deunan, the human race cannot turn back.
Why not let the new humans bear the sin of the human race?
We will survive even if it' s not a utopia.
We' il build a new future with our own hands!
Deunan.
No way, they have no weakness.
3000 meters to Tartarus!
We cannot hurt them at all!
Captain, we are approaching No. 7!
Which one is No. 7? the one in the middle.
Attack the legs of No. 6 and No. 8!
How about No. 5?
Let it go.
All fire on No. 6 and No. 8!
No. 6 is down!
Good.
How about No. 8?
Let me attract his fire
Deunan you approach him from below.
Roger.
Briareos
Deunan
Cannons have reached Tartarus!
They are climbing toward the top!
Deunan we are out of time.
No. 3 cannon is near the top!
We can' t stop it.
How come?
Why?
Briareos
Deunan, let me go!
I can' t do that!
Hurry, enter the password!
Mother!
They stopped.
All cannons stopped.
The D- tank is safe.
Briareos
Deunan, Hitomi.
Where are the old men?
Oh...
So the last letter of the access code...
They left it up to us.
Nothing changed.
It must be their unwillingness to change that makes the human race guilty.
I will continue fighting even like this.
For our children, for the truly new human race
See the crows?
They never tasted prince before.
Is this what you left me for?!
Fight!
You coward!
Fight me!
We have a pact!
Fight him, son.
- Fight me!
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!
Prepare for battle!
This is not honor!
This is not worthy of royalty!
If he doesn' t fight, Troy is doomed.
The fight is over.
The fight is not over.
Stand back, Prince Hector.
I' il kill him at your feet.
I don' t care.
Paris!
Go!
Get inside, Paris!
Archers!
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back, you fool!
- Now!
Get them in line!
Get the men back into lines!
Front line, push!
Forward.
Forward!
Apollonians!
Prince Hector!
We need to retreat!
My army' s never lost a battle yet!
You won' t have an army if you don' t fall back!
Back to the ships!
- Back to the ships!
- Retreat!
Go back!
Back.
Fall back!
- Men, fall back!
Halt!
We' re in range of their archers.
Have our men gather our fallen.
Send an emissary to them.
Would they have done the same for us?
Go!
Fall back into line!
You think I' m a coward.
I am a coward.
I knew he would kill me.
You were watching.
My father.
My brother.
Shame didn' t matter.
I gave up my pride...... my honor...... just to live.
For love.
You challenged a great warrior.
I betrayed you.
Menelaus was a brave man.
He lived for fighting.
And every day I was with him, I wanted to walk into the sea and drown.
I don' t want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.
They' re laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!
They think I' il sail home at first light.
Maybe we should.
Flee?
The men believe we came here for Menelaus' wife.
Won' t be needing her anymore.
My brother' s blood still wets the sand, and you insult him!
It' s no insult to say a dead man is dead.
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?
To protect Greece, not your pride.
Your private battle with Achilles is destroying us.
Hector is one man.
Look what he did to us today.
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!
I don' t care about the man' s allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.
He' s right.
Even if I could make peace with Achilles, the man won' t listen to me!
He' s as likely to spear me as to speak to me!
I' il talk to him.
He can have that damn girl.
I haven' t touched her.
Where is she?
They need some amusement after today.
Come on, give the bitch to me!
Who' s first?
Trojan whore!
What' s this?
- You won' t be needing that much longer!
Better to be a Spartan slave than a Trojan...
Achilles!
Are you hurt?
I watched you fight them.
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.
Eat.
I' ve known men like you my whole life.
You think you' re so different from 1000 others?
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
- And you hate these soldiers.
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.
Perhaps they deserve more than your pity.
- What life?
I chose nothing.
I was born, and this is what I am.
Why did you choose to love a god?
I think you' il find the romance one- sided.
Do you enjoy provoking me?
You' ve dedicated your life to the gods.
Zeus, god of thunder.
- Yes, of course.
Who blankets his bed with the skin of men he' s killed?
All the gods are to be feared and respected.
I' il tell you a secret...... something they don' t teach you in your temple.
The gods envy us.
They envy us because we' re mortal.
Everything' s more beautiful because we' re doomed.
You will never be lovelier than you are now.
We will never be here again.
I thought you were a dumb brute.
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.
Do it.
Nothing is easier.
Everyone dies.
Today or 50 years from now.
Do it.
You' il kill more men if I don' t kill you.
My lord, there' s...
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
Gather the stores.
Agamemnon is a proud man.
But he knows when he' s made a mistake.
The man sends you to make his apologies?
What are you doing enthralled to that pig of a king?
The world seems simple to you, my friend...... but when you' re a king, very few choices are simple.
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy like Agamemnon.
Are we supposed to fear him?
You don' t fear anyone.
That' s your problem.
We need you back.
Greece needs you.
Greece got along fine before I was born.
Greece will be Greece long after I' m dead.
I' m not talking about the land.
The men need you.
Stay, Achilles.
You were born for this war.
Things are less simple today.
Women have a way of complicating things.
Of all the kings of Greece, I respect you the most.
Sometimes you have to serve in order to lead.
I hope you understand that one day.
We' re going home?
We sail in the morning.
Greeks are being slaughtered.
If it' s fighting you still long for, there will always be another war.
These are our countrymen.
You betray all of Greece just to see Agamemnon fall.
Someone has to lose.
The gods favor our cause.
Now is the time to destroy the Greek army.
Their morale is battered.
Hit them now.
And they will run.
The Myrmidons didn' t fight yesterday.
There must be dissension among the Greeks.
But if we attack their ships, we will unify them.
If they decide to attack us, let them.
Our walls can' t be breached.
Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us.
We should not return the favor.
You' re confident about the meaning of these omens?
The desecration of his temple angers Apollo.
The gods have cursed the Greeks.
Prepare the army.
Am I still your captive?
You' re my guest.
In Troy, guests can leave whenever they want.
Would you leave this all behind?
Would you leave Troy?
Hold those barricades!
Archers to the rear.
Achilles.
Achilles.
Now!
Forward!
Enough for one day.
Yes.
Back to the ships!
Back to the ships!
It was his cousin.
- Back to the city!
- Back to the city!
We were going to sail home today.
I don' t think anyone' s sailing home now.
Achilles.
You violated my command.
No, my lord.
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.
You led them into combat.
I didn' t lead them, my lord.
Where' s Patroclus?
Patroclus!
We thought he was you, my lord.
He wore your armor, your shield, your greaves, your helmet.
He even moved like you.
Where is he?
- Where?
Hector cut his throat.
Don' t!
Where are you taking me?
Do you remember how to get here?
Yes.
The next time you come here, follow the tunnel.
There are no turns, so you can' t get lost.
When you get to the end, you' il be by the river.
Follow the river until you get to Mount Ida.
- Lf I die...
- No.... I don' t know how long the city will stand.
If the Greeks get inside the walls, it' s over.
They' il kill all the men, throw the babies from the city walls.
- That, for you, will be worse than dying.
Because I want you to be ready.
I want you to get our boy, and I want you to bring him here.
You save as many people as you can, but you get here.
I killed a boy today.
And he was young.
He was much too young.
That boy has just saved this war for us.
- Eudorus.
I need my armor.
No.
Don' t go!
Rope!
Hector' s my cousin.
He' s a good man.
Don' t fight him.
Please.
No.
Hector!
Hector!
Hector!
Hector!
Father...... forgive me for any offenses.
I' ve served you as best as I could.
Hector!
May the gods be with you.
Hector.
No father ever had a better son.
Hector!
Apollo guard you, my prince.
You' re the best man I know.
You' re a prince of Troy.
I know you' il make me proud.
Hector!
Remember what I told you.
You don' t have to go.
You remember what I told you.
Hector!
Hector!
I' ve seen this moment in my dreams.
I' il make a pact with you.
With the gods as our witnesses...... let us pledge that the winner will allow the loser all the proper funeral rituals.
There are no pacts between lions and men.
Now you know who you' re fighting.
I thought it was you I was fighting yesterday.
But I gave the dead boy the honor he deserved.
You gave him the honor of your sword.
You won' t have eyes tonight.
You won' t have ears or a tongue.
You' il wander the underworld, blind, deaf, and dumb, and all the dead will know:
This is Hector, the fool who thought he killed Achilles.
Get up, prince of Troy.
I won' t let a stone take my glory.
You lost your cousin.
Now you' ve taken mine.
When does it end?
It never ends.
Who are you?
I have endured what no one on earth has endured before.
I kissed the hands of the man who killed my son.
Priam?
How did you get in here?
I know my own country better than the Greeks, I think.
You' re a brave man.
I could have your head on a spit in the blink of an eye.
Do you really think death frightens me now?
I watched my eldest son die...... watched you drag his body behind your chariot.
Give him back to me.
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
Give him to me.
He killed my cousin.
He thought it was you.
How many cousins have you killed?
How many sons and fathers and brothers and husbands?
How many, brave Achilles?
I knew your father.
He died before his time.
But he was lucky not to live long enough to see his son fall.
You have taken everything from me.
My eldest son...... heir to my throne...... defender of my kingdom.
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.
But give me this small mercy.
I loved my boy from the moment he opened his eyes...... till the moment you closed them.
Let me wash his body.
Let me say the prayers.
Let me place two coins on his eyes for the boatman.
If I let you walk out of here...... if I let you take him...... it doesn' t change anything.
You' re still my enemy in the morning.
You' re still my enemy tonight.
But even enemies can show respect.
I admire your courage.
Meet me outside in a moment.
We' il meet again soon, my brother.
Your son was the best I' ve fought.
In my country, the funeral games last for 12 days.
It is the same in my country.
Then the prince will have that honor.
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.
Briseis?
I thought you were dead.
You are free.
If I hurt you...... it' s not what I wanted.
Go.
No one will stop you.
Come, my girl.
You' re a far better king than the one leading this army.
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I have to honor it?
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.
Peace!
Their prince is dead.
This is the time to attack!
Even with Hector gone, we have no way to breach their walls.
I will smash their walls to the ground...... if it costs me 40, 000 Greeks.
Hear me, Zeus!
I will smash their walls to the ground.
That' s good.
For my son back home.
Well, Odysseus.
You found a way to make the sheep invite the wolves to dinner.
I should never have struck you.
You' ve been a loyal friend all your life.
I hope I never disappoint you again.
It' s I who have been the disappointment.
Rouse the men.
Aren' t you coming with us?
I have my own battle to fight.
Let me march beside you.
I don' t want our men to be a part of this.
It' s a beautiful night.
This is the last order I give you.
Fighting for you has been my life' s honor, my lord.
Open the gates!
Here.
Plague.
Don' t go too close, my king.
This is the will of the gods.
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...... and Apollo desecrated their flesh.
They thought they could come here and sack our city in a day.
Now look at them, fleeing across the Aegean.
What is this?
The Greeks are praying for a safe return home.
This is a gift.
We should take it to the temple of Poseidon.
- I think we should burn it.
My prince, it' s a gift to the gods.
Father, burn it.
Look at them.
You' d think their prince had never died.
You are the prince now.
Make your brother proud.
Briseis.
Where is she?
- Where?
Please.
Then get him out of Troy.
Briseis!
Paris!
Andromache!
Helen.
We must go.
- Where?
- I' il show you.
Paris.
It' s a long way.
We must go now.
Paris!
Let it burn!
Let Troy burn!
Burn it all!
Burn Troy!
Burn Troy!
It' s a long way.
- Come.
- I stay.
- My father will never abandon the city.
I can' t leave him.
They' re burning it to the ground.
- What' s your name?
- Do you know how to use a sword?
The sword of Troy.
As long as it' s in the hands of a Trojan, our people have a future.
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.
- I will.
Paris, Briseis wasn' t in her room.
I' il find her.
Go.
- I' il stay with you.
- Go.
How could you love me if I ran now?
We will be together again, in this world or the next.
Go.
To the gate!
Soldiers of Troy...... you men are warriors!
To lead you has been my honor!
My prince!
The boatman waits for us.
I say we make him wait a little longer!
Paris!
Paris!
Have you no honor?
Have you no honor?
Too late for prayer, priestess.
I almost lost this war because of your little romance.
You' il be my slave in Mycenae.
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.
And at night...
Get up!
Hold her.
Come with me.
No!
Paris!
No!
Stop!
Please!
Paris!
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
You gave me peace...... in a lifetime of war.
Briseis, come.
You must.
No.
Troy is falling.
Go.
We must go.
I know a way out.
It' s all right.
Go.
Briseis, come.
Go.
Find peace...... my brother.
If they ever tell my story, let them say...... I walked with giants.
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...... but these names will never die.
Let them say I lived in the time of Hector...... tamer of horses.
Let them say...... I lived in the time of Achilles.

Lyekka?
Kai?
Kai, Kai, I can' t find Lyekka anywhere and I, er -
look, I think we' re being attacked.
By whom?
Well, I don' t know, does it matter?
Look Kai - I hate to break the news to you, but you' re not a plant!
You' re a Brunnen G warrior, and then you became an assassin for the Divine Order, you' re not meant to rot in a garden!
So get up out of there and kill!
May I help you?
What' s happening?
We are being attacked.
I know that, but by who?
Balloons.
From Fire?
Likely.
Lyekka!
Stan.
No.
I just wanted to make you happy Stan.
You have - you do!
Listen, Lyekka, are you OK?
I didn' t see them coming.
Stan?
Yes?
I have to say goodbye now.
No no no no no, we have to take you back to the Lexx and we can fix you up.
You make me happy.
I' il always be in your heart.
If you cry, you' il lose the memory of our love.
No.
She is dead.
No!
Yes.
And Stanley, you are in danger.
I can protect you, but I cannot protect you and the moth and Xev at the same time unless you stay together.
I guess you' re right.
Where' s Xev?
Xev!
They' ve got the moth!
Xev!
Xev!
Can you reach it?
Yes, I can.
Kai?
Yes?
I' m coming with you.
Hang on.
Xev?
Kai, you fly, I' il help Xev.
Xev, is that you?
It is Xev.
Xev, Xev?
I don' t get it.
Let' s go.
Where?
Out.
A moth, it doth go boom.
A moth, it doth descend.
Kai and Stanley assumed that you would be in the moth, exactly as I had anticipated.
It was an excellent plan.
Clever.
Brilliant.
Insightful.
Genius.
Stupid!
Stupid?
Do you doubt me, Xev?
Kai can' t be killed, he' s already dead.
But Stanley can.
And Kai does not float.
Correct?
My prince thinks of everything.
So, we have you, and Stanley and your dead man are out of the picture, isn' t that excellent?
Wonderful.
Satisfying.
Exciting.
Inevitable.
Evil.
That' s what we do.
We' re bad.
It' s our job.
Our lives.
Our commitment.
We' re the opposite of good.
Anything but.
You see Xev, that' s what Fire is all about.
It' s the repository of all that is not good.
Precisely.
Don' t you have a mind of your own?
Oooo...
No.
Am I beautiful?
The most.
Witty?
The sharpest.
Do you love me?
Completely.
Would you die for me?
In an instant.
I think I' m going to be sick.
You see Xev, Priest lives on Fire and I am its ruler.
And he knows that the least hint of disobedience would mean an immediate return to terrible pain and suffering, and as you know -
I' m very good with pain.
However, as he is my priest, he does not suffer much - for now, at least.
My prince - we have a problem.
The sky' s full of balloons.
They' re everywhere.
They' re all around us.
And one of them likely contains Xev.
Xev!
Can you hear us?
Kai!
That was Xev, did you hear that?
Xev!
We can hear you!
Xev, where are you?
Now the game will become more interesting.
A challenge.
A test.
A contest.
A battle.
Which you will lose.
A defeat.
A defeat?
For them.
Victory for us.
Precisely.
You see Xev -
Flying a balloon -
Flying a balloon is not a science.
It' s not an art.
There' s a lot of luck involved.
Sometimes you get an updraft -
Sometimes you don' t -
You never know.
But if you have a lot of balloons -
As we do.
Then you' re more likely to get a favourable wind than if you have only one.
It' s a simple matter of mathematics.
In order to destroy their balloon, our balloons must rise higher.
Or at least one of them must.
What?
Rise above all the others.
We need to shed some weight.
Her?
No.
Thank you!
We need you more than we need them.
You could be useful.
We gotta make it to another one of those cities.
Don' t you want to rescue Xev?
Well, yeah Kai, but we gotta get some help first.
- or perhaps, benefit from - a certain complacency in relation to the potential dangers they face.
Yeah.
They seem to live for the minute, in a kind of continuum, and will likely show no interest in our problem.
OK, what do you suggest then?
Engage the other balloons in battle, to save Xev now - on our own.
But what - but they' re all around us, how can we attack them all?
They appear to be organising themselves to attack us.
Oh, come on, there' s way too many.
They' re gonna beat us.
Likely you are correct.
OK, I' m correct.
What are we gonna do?
Whatever we can.
You know Kai, that' s easy for you to say because you' re an assassin.
You see, I' m a security guard class 4, formerly an assistant deputy backup courier.
You know, doing battle' s not part of my nature.
You are captain of the Lexx, the mightiest weapon in the two universes - what' s left of them - and have been so for more than four thousand years.
They seek advantage by rising above us, so they are shedding weight to gain in altitude.
I' m pumping this thing as hard as I can.
Did they hit us?
Not where it matters.
They are not trying to hit the gondola.
Their strategy is to puncture our balloon' s bag and make us descend.
Make sure they all stay out of range of his weapon.
Would you care for a drink?
Very well.
I won' t bother to offer you one again.
They' re rising above us.
Correct.
Well what can we do?
We can wait.
Wait for what?
For them to make a mistake.
That' s our entire plan?
Yes.
Yeah, well what if they don' t make a mistake?
Then they will succeed and we will fail.
What does that mean?
It means, that you will die -
And I will sink to the centre of this planet.
Why is it that I do all the pumping and you do all the standing around?
I will pump if you request, but then I will not be able to stop darts.
Oh, that' s OK, I like to pump.
Did they get the balloon?
Close.
You seem so far away from me now - and we used to be so close.
We were never close.
I remember your kisses well.
They were warm and close.
I was vulnerable, and you took advantage of me.
There was nothing real.
I see hate in your eyes.
You should be one of mine, you should be with me.
It' s a small step for you to take.
Take it Xev.
Be mine.
No.
Why do you do this?
I tempt those who can be tempted, and I punish those who deserve to be punished.
That is my function, my occupation, my job - my joy.
What is wrong with that?
And I also punish some who have done nothing wrong, who slip through the cracks - but then, no system is perfect.
You may not understand why I do what I do, but even less do I understand why you make the choices that you do.
I can see into you, Xev.
I can see things inside you that even you do not consciously remember.
You have every reason to hate.
Good baby.
Good baby.
Good baby.
Good baby.
Good baby - Xev of B3K.
Good food.
Good food.
Good food baby - Xev of B3K.
Your childhood, Xev of B3K?
No.
But you were raised in a box.
I was raised in the wife bank on B3K, yes.
But I really don' t remember much of it.
There was not much about it to remember.
We' ve been hit.
We' re losing altitude.
We have punctured their balloon bag.
They are going down.
Soon they will be in the water and we can shoot at them at will.
We do not want that.
So what do we do?
We wait.
Good morning matron.
Good morning, Xev of B3K.
Lesson 376.
Your husband asks you "Do you think I' m fat?"
What is the correct answer?
1.
No!
2.
It' s not what you look like on the outside, but the man on the inside that matters to me.
3.
I like a man with a lot of meat on his bones!
Can we get naked now and play ridethe tower of power?
It' s not what you look like on the outside, but the man on the inside that matters to me?
Wrong!
The correct answer is - I like a man with a lot of meat on his bones!
Can we get naked now and play ride the tower of power?
Xev of B3K - always flatter your man.
Never admit his failings.
Use any occasion to please him in bed.
Xev of B3K - at this rate you will not graduate from the wife bank for - 5. 9 years.
I' il try to do better in future, Matron.
It' s all a blur.
Hard to remember exactly - but also hard to forget.
So much pain.
So?
No.
Should we fire everything at them now?
Firing everything at them will have no effect on the dead man.
It is now time to change our strategy.
The right thing to do.
You should have come over to me Xev.
Never.
I once gave you the chance to let Stanley Tweedle destroy this planet, but you refused my chance because you are a good person -
- which means you are my enemy, which means you have to die.
Throw her over the side.
But, we will attach a piece of string to her, to improve our negotiating position.
What was that?
Xev.
The time has come for you to make a deal!
He wants to make a deal, what now?
We wait for him to make a mistake.
Well, he hasn' t been making too many so far.
Listen Kai, why don' t you just, you know, do the assassination thing with your brace and get this over with?
I would, if my brace were fully functional, but it is not.
What, what' s the deal?
The dead man will jump over the side and sink into the sea.
Unless he does that in ten seconds, Priest will cut the cord on Xev, and she will sink into the sea.
10.
No.
9.
8.
7..
No!
Don' t do it, Kai!
6.
5.
4..
You' re our only hope.
3.
2.
1..
He' s climbing over the side for you.
Isn' t it sweet?!
No, Kai!
No, Kai!
Why did you do that?
The ten seconds were up, so I cut the cord like you said.
I did not tell you to cut it.
I am deeply sorry, my prince.
It will not happen again - but I don' t know what I did wrong.
You - made a mistake.
Look.
Kai!
Bring me down to Xev.
There is a faint possibility that your stupidity will lead to my opportunity.
We certainly have the advantage of height now.
Thank you.
You' re welcome.
Oh, it' s nice to see you Xev.
Why don' t we just crash, down in the water?
In that case, I would be fine, but you and Xev would become very easy targets.
Kai.
Kai, I hate to interrupt your meditation, but things are not looking very good for us here.
Release the stays.
Release the stays?
Yes, we must release the stays which suspend the gondola from the balloon - now.
Fire everything.
We must kill them now, before they get any higher.
How can they get any higher?
Fire everything!
We have to kill them now!
Good move, Kai.
Look.
Shall I release the mainstay?
Yes.
The balloon' s losing air.
How can we make it to the Lexx?
We will have to be very lucky.
We' re already slowing down.
Soon we will start to drop, rapidly.
We must shed weight.
What weight?
Oh no no.
Look!
Are you ready?
Nearly.
We' re losing time.
What are you doing?
I have to release the mainstay from up here or else I will go down with the gondola.
You' re going down with the gondola.
I' m sorry, I' m not clear -
You' re dead weight.
Now please fall to your death with the gondola, and don' t waste anymore time about it.
Is that clear enough for you?
Very clear.
You are my prince.
Your mistake provided my opportunity.
Their balloon is losing air, ours is not.
It will be easy to rise above them and pick them off.
You are my prince.
Now get on with it.
I will get on with it!
You, you fool!
What do you think you will gain?
What else would you expect?
Now I will rise to the top.
No.
And I will rule this planet!
You will suffer!
We' re not gonna make it, are we?
No.
Our balloon is losing too much air.
Well what, what now?
Look, there.
Oh no.
No no no no no no.
You' re not actually suggesting that I let go and throw myself down there, and if I' m incredibly lucky land on Prince' s balloon, are ya?
No.
No.
Well that' s good because, you know, I wouldn' t die after I missed the balloon and hit the water, because my heart' d stop long before that.
We have to jump Stan.
No Xev.
I' m informing you right now that I am in no way equipped for a jump like that.
You know, my fingers won' t respond to the instructions from my brain to let go.
My brain wouldn' t even produce an instruction like that.
I will jump, and then I will bring you over.
Well how?
No no no no.
Your brace isn' t working right, remember?
Hopefully, you will still be close enough.
I think I must pick up Stan first, then I will grab you.
You go.
Captains first.
My heart' s still working.
I don' t believe it.
Xev' s balloon is outta control.
Fire your brace Kai, fire now!
She is out of range.
Well we have to go down and get her.
We will, but in a moth.
A moth?
We don' t have time.
The other balloons' il get to her first.
We are now in the divide between the atmospheres of the two planets.
Xev - will land on Fire.
We can reach her in a moth, before the other balloons.
All night by the Kai, Kai.
All night by his corpse I did moan.
I dreamed he was tweaking my circuits.
While I was tweaking his bone.
Do these mothbreeders ever stop?
No.
All night without Kai, Kai.
I' m lonely, I' m blue, and I' m sick.
I dream of his frozen kisses.
And fondling his frozen -
Kai!
Come here, oh dark dead and delicious one.
Kai!
Come back.
Come back.
You' il come back.
You' re just in an awfully big hurry.
I understand.
It' s not OK!
I love you Kai!!!
What are you doing here?
I must build more moths.
Are you one of the mothbreeders who were taken to Duketown?
I must build more moths.
I know this probably doesn' t mean anything to you -
But like me, you were a prisoner on the Cluster, and they turned you into what you are now.
But you were once a real person.
A real person who lived a real life.
Can you understand that, even a little?
You were a real person!
I must build more moths.
Poor you.
Poor me.
You again.
Me again.
How did you get here?
I died.
You don' t look dead.
I' m not.
I died, and now I have been reawakened here, for you.
Why?
I want to be with you when you die.
I' ve never seen anyone die for the first time.
What makes you think that I' m going to die?
You' re on the surface of the planet Fire, the sun' s up - you cannot last the hour.
And you?
Oh, I will also die.
How sad.
Not for me - I' m used to it.
And it will not be so bad for you, although your friends will miss you.
Do you know what a Cluster lizard is?
Not really.
A Cluster lizard is a very nasty animal, that I think originally came from a very hot place.
How does that matter?
You will see.
When?
In less than an hour.
We' il never find her.
We will search for the balloon.
How are you going?
Fine, thank you.
I' m hot, I have to stop.
Why aren' t you dying?
I' m very good with heat.
Ironically, I' m not.
How is it that you' re not dying?
I' m not all human.
Can you still find whatever memory you want with your hand, like you did before?
Yes.
Think Cluster lizard.
Then I guess you get to see me die.
Do you still feel anything for me?
A little.
You shouldn' t.
I agree.
Well - I didn' t admit it before, But I' m hot, too.
Really hot.
Hey, look, look, do you see it?
Yes.
She' s not in it.
She may be somewhere upwind.
I hope.
The dead do not hope.
Yeah, well Kai - the living certainly do.

well, sit down you never know that Weasleys were pure- bloods the way they behave they are emmbassing the wizarding world, all of them what' s wrong with you?
Crabbe stomachach
You know, I' m surprised the Daily Prophet _BAR_hasn' t done any report of all these attacks
I suppose Dumbledore' s trying to hush it all up.
Father' s always said Dumbledore was the worst thing _BAR_that' s ever happened to this place. you' re wrong
what? you think some one here is worse than Dumbledore? well, do you?
Harry Potter?
good one, Goyle, you absolutely right
Saint Potter
And people actually think he' s heir Slytherin!
but then you must have some idea who is behind it all you know I don' t, Goyle
I told you yesterday how many times do I have to tell you? is this yours?
but my father did say this it' s been 50 years since the chamber was opened he wouldn' t tell me who opened it only they were spelled the last time the chamber of secret was opened a mudblood died so it' s only matter of time before one of them' s killed this time as to me
I hope it' s Granger what' s the matter with you two you' re acting very odd it' s his stomachache calm down scar
hey, where are you going? that was close
Hermione, come on, we' ve got loads to tell you go away wait you' il see it' s awful
Hermione, are you ok?

look at my face
look at your tail
what' s this?
yark, looks like Moaning Myrtle flooded the bathroom
Come to throw something else at me?
Why would I throw something at you? don' t ask me
Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it' s funny to throw a book at me......
But it can' t hurt you if someone throws something at you
I mean, it' d just go right through you so!! Let' s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can' t feel it!
Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! _BAR_Fifty points if it goes through her head!
but, Who threw it at you, anyway?
I don' t know
I didn' t see them
I was just sitting in the U- bend, thinking about death and it fell right through the top of my head
Tom Maryold Riddle
my name is Harry Potter
"Hello, Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle"
do you know anything about the chamber of secrets
"yes" can you tell me?
"no" "but I can show you"
"let me take you back fifty years ago"
"13th June"
excuse me could you tell me what' s going on here? are you Tom Riddle?
"Riddle" up
Professor Dumbledore
Dumbledore it is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom yes, professor, I suppose
I have to see it for myself if the rumor was true
I am afraid, they are, Tom, they are true well this school as well
I don' t have home to go to, sir they won' t really close Hogwart, would they, professor?
I understand, Tom
I am afraid headmaster Dipper may have no choice sir, if it all stoped the person who' s responsible was caught is there something you wish to tell me?
no sir nothing very well then off you go goodnight, sir
what' s going on there? evening, Hagrid
I am going to turn you in, Hagrid I don' t think you meant to kill any one, but you can' t, you don' t understand
The dead girl' s parents will be here tomorrow.
The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing _BAR_that killed their daughter is slaughtered...... it wasn' t him
Aragog never kill no one, never monsters don' t make good pets, Hagrid just stand aside no
Stand aside, Hagrid no SESYTENOPEYlDE ORONYlEXRTlN
Aragog!
Aragog!
I can' t let you go
I have you warned for this, Hagrid you would be expelled
Hagrid
it was Hagrid
Hagrid opened the chamber of secret 50 years ago it can' t be Hagrid, just can' t be we don' t even know this Tom Riddle he sound like a dirty rotten snitch to me the monster had killed somebody, Ron what if he has done?
look, Hagrid' s our friend why don' t why just go and ask him about it?
That' d be a cheerful visit
Hello, Hagrid.
Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose _BAR_in the castle lately? mad and hairy? you wouldn' t be talking about me, now, would you? no
what' s that you got, Hagrid? oh, it' s Flesh- Eatin 'Slug Repellent for the mandrake, you know according to proffessor Sprout, they still gonna need bit grown- up to do, _BAR_but once their acne' s been cleared up, we' il be able to chop them up, _BAR_stew them, and then we' il get those people down at hospital unpetrified in meantime, you know, you three, best look after yourselves all right?
hello, Nevill
Harry, I don' t who did it, but you' d be better come come on
it has to be a Gryffindor nobody else know our password unless he wasn' t a student whoever he was, he must be looking something he found it
Tom Riddle' s diary is gone oh, well, listen up we play our game, Hufflepuff doesn' t stand a chance stronger, quicker, and smarter not to mention they' re deadly scared that_BAR_Harry' il petrify any one near him oh, that too professor McGonagall this match has been cancelled you can' t cancell quidditch silence, wood you and your teammates will go to Gryffindor tower, now
Potter you and I will find Mr. Weasley there are someting the both of you' il have to see
I warn you
This could be a bit of a shock
Hermione! she was found near the library alone with this does it mean anything to either of you? no
could I have your attention please becasue of recent events, these new rules will be put effect immediately all students will return to their house common room _BAR_by six clock every evening all students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher no exceptions
I should tell you this unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed
we got to talk to Hagrid, Ron
I can' t believe it' s him if he did set the monster loose last time he' il know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets that' s a start but you heard McGonagall but we are not allowed to leave tower except class
I think it' s the time to get my dad' s old cloak again
who' s there? hello? hello? what' s that for? oh, nothing,
I' ve being expecting..., and it doesn' t matter, come on in just made a pot of tea
Hagrid, are you ok?
I' m worried, I am all right did you hear about Hermone? oh, yeah, I heard about that, all right
look, we have to ask you something do you know who' s opened the chamber of secrets?
what you have to understand about that is quick, under the cloak don' t say a word, quiet, both of you
proffessor Dumbledor, sir good evening, Hagrid
I wonder, could we?.. of course, come in come in that' s dad' s boss
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!
Bad business, Hagrid, Very bad business.
Had to come. three attacks on Muggle- borns.
Things' ve gone far enough.
Ministry' s got to act.
I never, You know I never, Professor
I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence
Hagrid' s record is against him.
I' ve got to take him take me? take me where?
Not Azkaban prison?
I am afraid we have no choice, Hagrid already here, Fudge, good what are you doing here? get out of my house believe me, I absolutely have no pleasure at all being inside your - er you call this a house?
I simply called at the school and_BAR_was told that the headmaster was here. and what exactly is it that you want with me?
the other governors and I desided _BAR_it' s time for you to step aside.
This is an Order of Suspension
you' il find all twelve signatures on it.
I' m afraid we feel you' re losing your touch.
well, with all those attacks there' il be no Muggle- borns left at Hogwarts
I can only imagin what an awful loss that would be to the school. you can' t take professor Dumbledore away take him away, the muggleborns won' t stand a chance you have my word, There' il be killing next! you think so
Calm yourself, Hagrid
If the governors desire my removal
I will of course step aside however you will find the help will always be given to Hogwarts to those who ask for it
any more sentiments? shall we?
come, Hagrid well if if anybody was looking some stuff that all they have to do would be to follow the spiders yeah, that will lead them right that' s all I have to say oh, well, some one need to feed Fang when I am away good boy
Hagrid is right
Dumbledor gone here will be attack everyday
look come on come on, Fang
come on what? you heard what Hagrid said follow the spiders they' re heading to the dark forest why spiders why can' t we follow the butterflies?
Harry, I don' t like this
Harry, I don' t like it at all
can we go back now? come on
who is it? don' t panic
Hagrid, is that you? we are friends of Hagrid' s
and you you are Aragog, aren' t you? yes
Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he is in trouble, up in the school, for the punish of attacks they think it' s Hagrid they think he open the chamber of secrets they think he opened the chamber of secrets like before that' s a lie
Hagrid' d never opened the chamber of the secrets then, you are not the monster no the monster was born in the castle
I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler but if you are not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago we do not speak of it it' s an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others but have you seen it?
I never saw any part of the castle with the books in which Hagrid kept me the girl was discovered in bathroom when I was accused, Hagrid brought me here
Harry what?
well, thank you we' il just go go
I think not
My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.
But I can not deny them fresh meat, _BAR_ when it wanders so willingly into our midst. goodbye friends of Hagrid can we go back now?
know any spells? one but it' s not powerful enough for all of them where is Hermione when you need her
let' s go
RONlEGEZlMElY
glad we' re out there
ERMONlAEXPAY
thanks for that don' t mention it
get out of here now come on come on, a little faster
go, go
get us in the air the flying gear is jammed come on oh, I am trying
follow the spiders follow the spiders if Hagrid ever get out of Azkaban, I will kill him
I mean what was the point of sending us in there what we found out? we know one thing
Hagrid' d never opened the chamber of secrets he was innocent
I wish you were here, Hermione we need you now more than ever
what' s that?
Ron this why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked come on of many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land none is more more deadly than the Basilisk capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meets this giantic serpent' s eyes
Spiders flee before it
Ron, this is it the monster in chamber of secrets is a basilisk that' s why I can hear its speak it' s a snake but if it kills by looking people in the eye why is it no one' s died?
because no one did look in the eye not directly at least
Colin saw it through his camera
Justin Justin must' ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick!
Nick got the full blast of it, _BAR_ but he is a ghost, he couldn' t die again and Hermione had the mirror
I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners_BAR_ in case it came along and Mrs. Norris
I' m pretty sure she didn' t have a camera or mirror, Harry the water that was the water on the floor that night she only saw the Basilisk' s reflection
spiders flee before it it all fits but how' s Basilisk been getting around?
A dirty great snake...
Someone would' ve seen it...
Hermione thought that too pipes it' s using the plumbing remmeber what Aragog said: about that girl 50 years ago? she died in the bathroom what if she' d never left?
Moaning Myrtle?
All students to return to their House dormitories at once.
All teachers return to second floor corrider.
Immediately
as you can see the heir of Slytherin has left another message the worst fear has been realized, _BAR_a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself students must be sent to home
I am afraid this is the end of Hogwarts so sorry, dozed off, what I missed a girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart your moment has come at last my? no... no...
Weren' t you saying just last night that you' ve known all along _BAR_where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
that' s settled we will leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy your skills, after all, are legend very well
I' il just be in my office, getting... getting ready
who is it the monster has taken another?
Ginny Weasley
her Skeleton will lie in the chamber forever
Ginny...
Lockhart maybe useless, but if He' s going to try and get into the Chamber. at least we can tell him what we know professor, we have some information for you are you going somewhere? oh, yes, eh.. urgent call, unavoidable, got to go what about my sister? as for that, most unfortunate no one regrets more than I you are the defense against the dark art teacher you can' t go now
I must say, when I took the job, _BAR_there was nothing in the job description about the... you are running away?
After all that stuff you did in your books
Books can be misleading you wrote them my dear boy, do you use your common sense?
My books wouldn' t have sold half as well _BAR_if people didn' t think I' d done all those things you are a fraud you' ve just been taking credit for other wizards have done? so anything you can do? yes now you mentioned it
I am rather gifted in memory charms otherwise you see, all those wizards would' ve gone blabbing and I' d never sold another book in fact
I, eh, I am 'eh, going to have to do the thing to you don' t even think about it
oh, who' s there? oh, hello, Harry what do you want? to ask you how you died?
it was dreadful it happened right here in this dirty cubicle
I' d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses
I was crying then I heard somebody come in who was it, Myrtle?
I don' t know
I was distrought! but they said something funny a kind of madeup language, and I realized it was a boy' s speaking so I unlocked the door to tell him, "go away" and, I died.. just like that, how?
I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. over there by that sink
this is it this is it, Ron, _BAR_I think this is the entrance of chamber of secrets say something
Harry, say something in Parseltongue.
excellent, Harry ha, good work, then, I' il just be... there is no need for me to stay
you first no boys, what good it will do? better you than us
you sure you don' t want to test it first?
really quite filth down here all right
let' s go oh, Harry if you die down there, you are welcome to share my toilet eh, thanks, Myrtle
now, remmeber any signs of movement, close your eyes straight away go on this way
what is this? it looks like a snake it' s snake skin bloody hell
I am sure this must be 60 feet long hard to a liar this one
adventure ends here, boys but don' t fright the world will know our story but however it' s too late to save the girl how you two tragically lost your minds _BAR_at the sight of her mangled body so, you first, Mr. Potter say goodbye to your memories Obliviate!
Harry Harry
Ron
Ron, are you ok?
I' m fine
Hello who are you?
I' m Ron Weasley
Really and who am I?
Lockhart' s memory charm backfired he hasn' t got clue who he is it' s an odd sort of place, isn' t it?
do you live here? no really? eh... what do I do now? you wait here and try to shift some these rocks, so we can get back through
I' il go and find Ginny ok
Ginny, oh, please don' t be dead wake up, wake up, please wake up she won' t wake
Tom
Tom Riddle? what do you mean she won' t wake? she is not... she' s still alive but only just are you a ghost? a memory, reserved in a diary for 50 years she' s cold as ice
Ginny, Please don' t be dead wake up you got to help me, Tom, there is a Basilisk
It won' t come until it is called give me my wand, Tom
You won' t be needing it
listen, we' ve got to go, we' ve got to save her
I am afraid I can' t do that, Harry, you see as poor Ginny growes weaker
I grow stronger yes, Harry, _BAR_it was Ginny Weasley who opened the chamber of secrets no, she couldn' t, she wouldn' t it was Ginny who set the Basilisk on mudblood and Filch' s cat
Ginny wrote the frighten messages on the walls why? because I told her to you' il find that I can be very persusive not that Ginny knew what she was doing, she was shall we say, in a kind of trance still, the power of diary began to scare her she tried to dispose it in girl' s bathroom and then you should find it, but you the very person I was most anxious to meet why did you want to meet me?
I knew I have to talk to you meet you if I could so I desided to show you my capture of that brainless Hagrid to gain your trust
Hagrid is my friend and you framed him, didn' t you? it was my word to against Hagrid only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent but Dumbledore saw right through you he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that
I knew it wouldn' t be safe to open the chamber again _BAR_while I was still at school so I desided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen- year- old self in its pages so that one day
I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin' s noble work but you haven' t finished it this time in few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready and every one who was petrified will be right to go haven' t I told you? killing mudbloods doesn' t matter to me any more?
For many months now, my new target has been - you. how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort' s powers were destroyed?
Why do you care how I escaped? _BAR_Voldemort was after your time......
Voldemort is my past, present, and future
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT you you are the heir of Slytherin you are LORD VOLDEMORT so we... you didn' t think I was going to keep_BAR_my filthy Muggle father' s name? no
I fashioned myself a new name a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Dumbledore' s been driven out of this castle _BAR_by the mere memory of me! he would never be gone. not as long as those remain loyal to him
Fawkes?
so this is what Dumbledore sends his defender!
A songbird and an old hat!
Let' s match the powers of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous Harry Potter
so, I have asks, Potter, no one will save you
Potter, it only obeys me
no your bird may have blinded Basilisk but it can still hear you
yes, Potter the process is nearly complete in a few minutes
Ginny Weasley will be dead and I will cease to be a memory
Lord Voldemort will return very much alive
Ginny
remarkable, isn' t it? how quickly the venom of Basilisk can penetrate the body
I guess you have a little more than a minute to live you will be with your dear mudblood mother, soon, Harry
funny the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl what are you doing? stop no
Ginny
Harry it was me
I swear
I didn' t mean to
Riddle made me
Harry you are hurt
Don' t worry
Ginny you need to get yourself out follow the chamber, and you will find Ron
you were briliant, Fawkes
I just wasn' t quick enough
of course
Phoenix tears have healing powers thanks it' s all right, Ginny it' s over it' s just memory amazing this is just like magic
you both realized, of course in the past few hours you' ve broken perhaps a dozen school rules yes, sir there are sufficient evidence to have you expelled yes, sir yes, sir therefore it is only fitting that you will both receive special awards _BAR_for services to the school
thanks, sir now, Mr. Weasley if you would have an hour to deliver this release paper to Azkaban
I believe we want our gamekeeper back
Harry
First, I want to thank you, Harry you must' ve shown me the real loyalty down the chamber nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you and second
I sense that something is troubling you am I right, Harry? it' s just you see, sir, I couldn' t help but notice certain thing, certain certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me
I see, well you can speak Parseltongue,?
Harry, why? because
Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue if I am not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you _BAR_the night he gave you that scar.
Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? not intentionally but yes so the sorting hat was right
I should be in Slytherin it is true, Harry it was just many qualities Voldemort himself prizes determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, _BAR_a certain disregard for rules, why then the sorting hat placed you in Gryffindor because I asked it to exactly, Harry,
Exactly it makes you different from Voldemort it is not our abilities that show what we truly are it is our choices if you want proof why you belong to Gryffindor and I suggest you look more closely at this
Godric Gryffindor it' d take a true Gryffindor to pull out of that hat
Dobby, so, this is your master your family you serve is Malfoy' s
I will deal with you later
out of my way
Potter so, it is true you have returned when the governors learned Arthur Weasley' s daughter_BAR_ was taken into Chamber, they saw fit to sending me back ridiculars curiously, Lucius
Several among them are under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn' t want to agree to suspend me in the first place. how dare you? beg your pardon my sole concern has always been, and will always be the welfare of school and of course its students
the culprit has been identified
I would assume? oh, yes and who was it?
Voldemort only this time he chosed to act through somebody else by means of this
I see fortuanately our young Mr. Potter discovered it one hopes that no more _BAR_of Lord Voldemore' s old school things should find their way into innocent hands, the consequence for the one responsible would be severe well, let' s just hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day don' t worry
I will be
Dumbledore come Dobby, we leave here
sir, I wonder if I could have that
Mr. Malfoy
Mr. Malfoy
I have something of yours mine?
I don' t know what are you talking about
I think you do, sir
I think you slipped the diary to Ginny Weasley' s cauldron, that day in Diagon alley? do you?
why don' t you prove it?
come, Dobby open it
Dobby master has given Dobby a sock! what?
I didn' t master has presented Dobby with cloth
Dobby is free
you lost me my servant!
you shall not harm Harry Potter
you parents would middle some fools too mark my words,
Potter one day soon, you are going to be the same, stick it
Harry Potter freed Dobby
How can dobby ever repay him? just promise me something anything Sir... never try to save my life again
welcome back, Sir Nicholus thank you good evening, sir Nicholus good evening good to see you, sir Nicholus thank you hello
Hermione welcome back thanks sir Nicholus
Harry it' s Hermione
eh.... eh... well! welcome back, Hermione it' s good to be back congratulations
I can' t believe you solved it well, we had loads of help from you we couldn' t have done it without you thanks could I have your attention please
before we begin the feast
let us have a round of applause for proffessor Sprout
Madam Pomfrey whose mandrake juices' s been sowed successfully _BAR_and ministered to all who had been petrified
also, in the light of recent events as a school treat all exams have been cancelled
sorry
I am late
the owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused some bloody bird called Eroll
I, now, just ought to say that, _BAR_if it hasn' t been for you, Harry and Ron and Hermione, of course
I would, I' il be still, you know, where...
I just like to say, thanks
it' s not Hogwarts without you, Hagrid
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data.
Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time!
Sonic!
It' s finally done!
See, isn' t it great?
It' s a jet- propelled body board!
Come on, Sonic.
Don' t you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I' il try it myself!
I guess Tails is still just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It' s okay if you can' t swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don' t get cocky and run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic!
Help me!
Wake up, Sonic!
Come on, Sonic!
Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I' m fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?

I' il pass on this one.
Sonic, we' ve got to hurry up and do something!
You' re the one who can fly, why don' t you go do something?
Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this all by myself!
Mister!
Tails, it' s you!
It' s nice to see you again.
That' s why I' m here.
Mister, this isn' t the time to worry about that.
Your rocket' s on fire!

No wonder it' s getting so warm in here!
Just hold on!

Look out!
What are you talking about?
Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man!
Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I' m a little older now, but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time.
Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn' t you say you had some urgent business?
Oh, right.
It' s a real emergency.
It' s the President.
He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it!
Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could' ve done that.
Old man, take care of the place while we' re gone!
I understand!
I don' t think so.
Let' s go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what' s the urgent business?
It' s been a long time, hasn' t it, Sonic, Tails.
It' s Eggman!
Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way.
That' s a funny way to show your gratitude.
Don' t do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter and everyone else, listen to him!
That' s a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn' t you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom, so you' d better listen to everything I have to say.
No way.
Don' t you care what happens to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what Eggman has to say!
I guess I don' t have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions.
The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet!
Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the inner dimension, where I have created a high- tech city called Eggmanland.
Black Eggman.
I don' t know where he came from, but he attacked my city with a battalion of robots.
Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
He jammed the Robot Generator, causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations, if the Robot Generator isn' t stopped by sunrise tomorrow, there will be a giant explosion!
Fine!
But don' t blame me when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman?
Then he has to get into Eggmanland and stop that generator!
And it' s the fastest one here that should do it!
Forget about it.
You' re the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you?
Sonic!
Please do it!
South Island...
No, the entire planet is depending on you!
Sonic, I don' t care what happens to Eggman or Papa, but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out of 100 he' s lying.
But what if this is that one other time?
Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I' il do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It' s a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland using the shortest route, as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you?
Knowing him, he might' ve put a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows how to get to Eggmanland.
We don' t have any other choice but to trust this thing.
Guess you' re right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don' t like it when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
Give up!
We' ve played a hundred times!
I' il stop being your hostage.
All right, we' il keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again!
I quit.
I want to go for a drive.
Absolutely not!
No, no!
I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don' t touch that!
No, wait!
Don' t play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that!
Sarah!
That must be the entrance to the Land of Darkness!
We' re getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We' re almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I' m fine, but I' m worried about that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
Tails, doesn' t something seem a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest way to the generator!
There' s even be a warp zone right up ahead!
Let' s get moving!
What is this place?
It says these are ancient ruins.
Ancient ruins?
These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to be really near.
Let' s go somewhere high and see if we can see it from there.
Let' s go!
The ruins are sinking right into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it' s because the Robot Generator is out of control and causing reactions under the ground!
Right!
We should hurry!
I' m afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go straight ahead, right?
That' s what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct.
I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don' t have time to play your little games!
Get out of our way!
I don' t think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of a super polymer alloy!
Ouch!
Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding?
Come out here!
We don' t have time to mess around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It' s past that highway!
Good!
Let' s go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can' t keep up right now, so we' il just have to finish this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn' t know that thing could fly!
Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We' re safe!
Don' t think you' re safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you' il both drown in the ocean below.
I can' t swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I' ve finally gotten those two out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let' s go.
Why me?
Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I' d fall for a stupid trick like that?
Take this!
What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it' s time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off.
There' s no way those missiles could' ve gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It' s coming back at you, Black Eggman!
Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet in the world, but it you can' t run, you' re just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland!
Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I' il save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no!
If my tails are stuck together, I can' t fly!
I' ve got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn' t matter.
You' re running away?
I' m not going to let you go, Black Eggman!
Don' t worry, we' il meet again soon!
Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic' s ruined things again!
He' d better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he' il have to fight something even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You' re talking about yourself!
You' d better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I' il never forgive you!
Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Yeah, that' s one more job that I' m not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we' ve been friends for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab.
So will you return to treasure hunting?
Of course!
After all, that' s what I live for!
The sun' s already setting!
We' ve got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That' s Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles!
See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I' d worry about you two if I sent you in alone!
See you!
What are you waiting for?
If you don' t hurry, that thing' s going to explode!
Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away.
You' re right.
Come on, let' s go!
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I' m really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don' t let your guard down or you' il seriously regret it, Knuckles.
I' il be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me and go on ahead!
Tails, fly!
You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It' s too heavy for me to move!
Sonic!
I' il have you out of there in no time!
Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something' s moving!
It' s a robot that looks exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It' s pretty!
Black Eggman' s ghost!
It' s broken.
Watch where you' re putting your hands!
I' m sorry, I didn' t mean to!
Ow!
Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman here together?
I get it, you' re Black Eggman!
Look at that, now you' ve made her cry.
Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme.
He planned the whole thing to trap you!
What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don' t believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You' re kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don' t you think?
You might have made a robot that looks like him, but he' s no match for the real Sonic!
Tails, it should be apparent to you.
Sonic wasn' t being electrocuted earlier.
Instead, I was transferring all his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
What are you planning on doing with that thing?
Isn' t it obvious?
I' m going to use Metal to destroy the real Sonic, and then I' m going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There' s no way you' il get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you' ve defeated him.
Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don' t try to help me.
I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he' s fast!
This is the first time I' ve ever seen Sonic like this!
That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don' t hurry then Sonic...
Calm down, Tails!
There' s no way that either one of us can catch up with them.
We' ve got to think of another way!
That' s right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn' t he?
I' m sorry, was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don' t be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer.
No, I want to go home now!
I' il show you something really spectacular.
Where did he go?
That' s it!
Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Hey, Tails, what' s wrong with you?
That' s a warp zone right in front of us!
We' re catching the tornado, and we' re going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you' re back already?
Sonic, what' s the matter?
Please stop it!
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland.
Is this all part of Black Eggman' s plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do something like this is Eggman!
It' s a lucky thing no one was staying here.
That old man was watching the house for us!
Old man!
Old man!
It doesn' t look like anyone touched the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic' s favorite clothes!
Don' t blame me if he gets mad at you!
Don' t worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It' s Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he' s going, the Land of the Sky won' t last more than a few hours.
Now I can take my plan to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo!
You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing!
Let' s hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave me and Metal Sonic are built out of the same kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really?
You might be able to find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren' t in the same place any more?
Don' t worry.
Sonic and Metal will definitely be together.
I don' t get it.
How come?
Well, all of Sonic' s data was input into Metal' s memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That' s why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man his favorite clothes.
I understand that, but Metal' s still a robot.
Metal is operating on Sonic' s thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic' s ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words, it' s just like they' re twins.
They' re twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded!
Forest Town is currently on fire!
We' ve discovered the source of the disturbances.
We' il patch it through to the monitors.
Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Get Sonic' s house on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I' m busy!
Isn' t somebody going to pick that up?
Hey, Tails!
Isn' t anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What' s he doing now?
Hey, it' s me!
Listen to me right now!
Shut up!
Who is this?
Who are you?
I' m Knuckles, Sonic' s best friend.
I see.
Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I' m busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don' t I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress?
What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land of the Sky, it' il just be the two of us.
Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep, close your eyes...
Who told you I wanted to marry you anyway?
I won' t do it!
Never!
So that' s what really happened.
But I still don' t think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It' s possible.
I' ve traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet, and I' ve seen it.
At the northernmost tip of this continent, all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents.
They' re shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion, the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice.
Due to the centrifugal force of the planet, they' il be thrown into outer space.
This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don' t tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you' re safe!
I heard all of it.
Sonic, you don' t understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt the glaciers to the north!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We' il have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what!
He' s headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don' t want to get married at the North Pole!
Why me?
I told you to stop!
Now we have to access Metal' s memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic' s personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman' s.
Don' t worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic.
I know what to do!
Oh no, I' m too late.
Where' d he go?
He' s got to be around here somewhere!
What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We' il fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What?
This world isn' t big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling' s mutual.
You might know everything I' m going to do, but I know everything you' re going to do too!
It' s a strange feeling!
Sonic, you' re still alive?
Sonic, what' s wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You' re a perfect target for me now, fox!
Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can' t stop!
You saved me!
Thank you, Mr. Mole!
Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did!
There you are Sarah.
It' s time for you to come with me now.
Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn' t think you' d stoop that low.
Look, it' s Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed, then that' s it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you' re a real man, aren' t you?
Right!
Here we go!
You' re totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles!
You stopped it!
My hat' s on fire!
Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you' re doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that' s right!
I hope this works!
No!
If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I' il have to marry Eggman!
And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails!
You saved us!
Who is that?
It doesn' t look like Eggman.
That' s papa' s rocket!
What did you say?
What?
Is the door stuck?
We' re in trouble!
The heat from the lava could cause it to explode!
Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let' s go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we' il all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Sonic!
I' il take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic' s personality?
Lmpressive, Tails.
But you' re too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don' t do it, Sonic!
What are you doing?
Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don' t do it, Sonic!
He' il drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don' t do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don' t look so sad, Sonic.
It' s not like you at all.
She' s right!
It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You' re all fools!
I still have all of Sonic' s data!
Next time, I' il build a stronger Metal that won' t have Sonic' s personality.
And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman!
What are you doing?
Stop!
It' s finally over.
Thank goodness everything' s all right!
Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we' re finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why' d you hit me?
I was getting you back for stepping on my head!
I don' t remember doing that!
You did!
I don' t remember!
Not so fast!
You' re not going to get away from me!
I' il get your data again, Sonic!
What?
What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will!
Hang on!
Wait, come back!
Sonic!
Sonic, I' il get your data again!
I' m getting out of here!
I' il see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
I' m so worry.
Okay.
Alicia, I have been thinking about...
I let you realize the inability to discuss the situation with you.
I don' t have other choice.
I do understand.
I' m... really sorry.
Everything is going to be alright.
Everything is going to be alright.
Just have to talk quietly.
They maybe listening.
There maybe microphones.
When I am telling you everything now, it' s breaking the protocol.
But you need to know.
Because you have to help me to get out off here.
Alicia, I have been doing top secret work for the government.
There is the threaten exist.
We cannot stop them for portions.
lnteractions.
My profile is too high.
So I Just simply don' t do it with me.
They are keeping me here, because I tried to stop from doing my work.
You have to go to Wheeler.
You have find William Patcher...
Stop...
Stop!
I went to Wheeler.
Good...
There is no Patcher.
Of course there are, I have been working for...
Doing what?
Breaking codes?
Dropping the packages at the secret mailbox for the government to pick up?
How do you know that?
Sow followed you.
They haven' t been opened.
It isn' t real.
There is no conspirancy, John.
There is no William Patcher.
It' s in your mind.
You understand, baby?
You' re sick.
You' re sick, John.
John!
John!
Code red.
Dr Rosen, code red.
Observation room 2.
John?
The implant' s gone.
I can' t find it.
It' s gone.
He has the nightmare because his friend there.
He' s not knowing what' s true.
lmagine that he would suddenly learn that the people, the places and the moments.
Most important to him are all gone.
Not there.
But worse, they' ve never been.
One kind of hell would that be.
Administering insulin.
How often?
Five times a week.
John always spoke so fondly being here in Princeton.
And Hensen is running the department now.
So he keep reminding us, reminding us.
Yeah.
John won' t come here to the campus though.
It is a shame.
Alicia, how... how are you holding up?
Division has passed.
They are saying with medication and those dressing in...
No...
I mean...
I mean how are you?
I think often when I feel...
It' s obligation.
A guilt... over warning to leave.
Rich, I guess.
John... against God...
But then I look at him.
And i force to see myself the man that I married.
And he becomes that man that he has transform into someone that I love.
And I transform to someone who loves him.
It' s not all of the time, but... it' s enough.
I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.
Someone lucky...
This is ours.
This is it?
It' s nice.
It' s here where I work.
John, you have a visitor.
- Hi.
I hope it' s okay.
Hey, chief.
Cigarette?
No, thanks.
I' ve quit, actually.
Hello.
Hey, John.
Have you met Harvey?
John, I...
You can have a little fun.
Jesus Christ, John.
I should have know.
Here you go.
I can take those later.
You are suppose to take them now.
Can I bring you something?
It' s okay.
So...
I' il go back tonight.
You know Bender...
He really wanted to stop by... and something like seeing you...
You know, say hi.
I suppose that would be too.
But at last, I' m stop with me.
I' m trying to hold the remark on hypothesis.
I figure if I have dazzled it, they would have to reinstead me.
First, it' s difficult with the medication... because it is hard to see the solution.
You should go easy.
There are other things besides... besides work.
What are they?
What are you thinking about?
What do people do?
Slave, John.
Just have meaning.
You could try live in a house.
You know, maybe try talk to people.
You can try taking out the garbage.
Who... who' re talking to?
Garbage man.
Garbage man don' t come at night.
I guess here around, they do.
Sorry.
ls that the medication?
My mother is going to keep the baby a little longer tonight.
I' il get three hour overtime.
I' m going to bed.
Good night.
Good to see you, John.
It has been a while.
Patcher?
Yes, sir.
You' re not real.
Of course I am.
Don' t be ridiculous.
And don' t think that I will go that way, John.
It' s time for you to get back to work.
Here in U. S.
We have brought it to the mountain, to you.
We have known the bomb' s location somewhere in the eastern seabroad.
But we haven' t able to pin point it' s exact position.
Their codes have grow to increasing complex.
Look at this, John.
What?
What?
Dr Rosen said...
Let' s get to the definite reality.
Psychological bullshit!
Look at me, John.
John, look at me.
Do I look like an imagine?
Wheeler has no record of you.
Do you think we list our personal?
John, I' m sorry that you have to go through all these.
I' ve gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back.
I can restore your status in Wheeler.
I can let the world know what you did.
But I need you now, soldier.
I am so scared that you are not real.
Listen, I' m not coming.
I am Just going to grab the laundry, okay?
I' il do his bath.
It' s okay.
Okay.
John?
This is going to wet the baby' s.
Oh God...
Charles was here.
He said it was okay.
There' s no one here.
Charles was watching...
There' s no one here.
He has been inJecting with the insulin...
And my imply resolve.
I can' t tell you because it is all under protection.
Alicia...
No...
Hello, I need Dr Rosen' s office please.
You got to stop her, John.
You leave her out of this.
Who are you talking to?
It' s not her fault.
John.
It' s your comprimises again...
Don' t you won' t.
You' il go back to the hospital.
John, answer me!
Can' t please people, or you will die.
Alicia, please put the phone down.
I can' t let that happen.
Yes, hello.
Yeah, I need Dr Rosen.
ls he in?
I' m sorry I have to do that.
No!...
Alicia, you know I have to do that.
Go away from me...
She is too greater risk.
Go away.
I don' t mean to hurt you.
Finish her.
She knows too much now.
Uncle John.
You take care your pathetic piece of shit or I' il take care off you.
John, please.
Do what he says.
Now.
Uncle John.
John, please.
Now!
Charles is watching her.
With Alicia.
She never gets old.
Marcee can' t be real.
She never gets old.
You see them now?
Yes.
Why did you stop your medicine?
Because I couldn' t do my work.
I couldn' t help with the baby.
I couldn' t...
I couldn' t respond to my wife.
I think that' s getting better than being crazy.
We' il need to start you on a higher run of insulin shoots and your medication...
No.
It has to be another way.
Gets to it is generative.
Someday it' s maybe symptom free.
But overtime, you' re getting worse.
So it is.
It' s a problem with no solution.
I solve problems.
It isn' t math.
You can' t come up with a formula that you can change the way you experience the world.
All I have to do is plan my mind.
No theory, no proof.
There isn' t a way out of this.
Why cannot?
Because your mind is the problem in the first place.
I can work it out.
All I need is time.
ls that the baby?
Baby is still at my mother' s, John.
Without treatment, John.
Pathetics may take over.
You are almost ready.
Rosen is waiting outside.
I can' t go back to that hospital.
I won' t come home.
He has commitment papers for me to sign.
Or maybe you won' t sign.
Maybe you Just give us sometime.
I will try to figure this out.
Rosen is right about one thing.
You shouldn' t be here.
I am not safe anymore.
Would you have hurt me, John?
I don' t know.
Maybe I should let Dr Rosen try to determine.
Rosen said you wasn' t tried to kill me or anything.
You will know what' s real.
This...
This...
This is real.
Make me the partner to awake from the dream.
Maybe it' s here.
I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.
Come.
Jesus Christ.
I don' t have that one, my savor complex text on the completely different form.
I heard what had happened.
I wanted to write.
I tried to call you since you left...
This is Helinger' s old office.
Yeah...
I stole it from him.
It seems that you won after all, Martin.
They were wrong, John.
Please.
Have a seat.
It' s so good to see you.
What brings you back to Priceton?
John, I' m sorry.
But you have to tell him.
Tell him you are a genius, John.
Tell him your work is critical, please.
ls there any chance that you could ignore what I Just did?
Of course, what' s old friends for?
ls that what we are, Martin?
Friends?
John, of course.
Of course, we always have been.
Alicia and I think that...
That might be some good.
There are several attachments.
Familiar places, familiar people.
Might help me elbow out... from this... from this certain delusions that I have.
So I am here.
Quite some of the people Just say no.
But I was wondering if I could hang around.
Will you be needing an office?
No...
No... lcould Just work out in the library.
But he doesn' t have an lD.
Why can' t people read their memos, huh?
Then he goes totally nuts.
Shit...
Shit...
You are not real...
ls that what you are, soldier?
Some useless cold.
The local banned man?
I am not a soldier.
You can handle by yourself.
Old, worthless, disguided.
There' s no mission.
The world that you are walking through, the world will burn ash.
You are not real.
You' re still talking to me, soldier.
There' s no mission.
I am not a soldier.
John...
I Just heard what happen.
I' m sorry, John.
I' m not a soldier.
John...
Hey, Nash.
Hey, Nash.
John!
You should have seen those faces.
John...
I know.
But I don' t know the way how...
Sometimes I really miss talking to him.
Maybe Rosen' s right.
Maybe I should think about going back to the hospital again.
Come here.
Maybe try again tomorrow.
John, you can' t let go me forever.
Charles, you are a very good friend to me.
The best.
But I won' t talk to you again.
I Just can' t.
The same goes to you, baby.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
How is it matter if I' m on your course?
It' s... it' s an honour, Professor Nash.
ls something wrong?
This would be my first class.
Good morning, young lifes.
It' s Just not going to work, John.
You' re Just humiliating yourself.
It' s pathetic.
You' re being pathetic.
I' m ashamed of you.
Are you coming?
You' re going to be late.
Dad, you got my book.
What?
You got my book.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
See you tonight.
Bye, honey.
Do you Just solve Rima?
What do you think?
That' s an analogue for non- communitive extensions.
Yes, it is.
It' s Just a piece of work, not so prodically, so...
But...
I believe I' m making progress.
You' re... you' re John Nash, right?
Hello.
I' m studying your record.
The one you wrote here at Princeton.
To come up with something totally original the way you did.
You know, I was young.
I have been developing a theory.
I believe I can prove the extentions in covering space.
That everything... everything is connected.
That is all part of the same subJect.
When was the last time you ate?
You know, food.
My wife, she loves mayonnaise.
Go on.
The factor is in two categories.
I was thinking I am not a teacher.
Classroom with 50 students could be don thing for anyone.
John, besides you are a terrible teacher.
I am a quiet taste, Martin.
I was Just hoping that there is something that I can contribute.
What about the...
You know, are they gone?
No, they are not gone.
But I got used to ignore.
You think that is what' s like.
All our dreams and nightmares, Martin?
We got to keep feeding them to let them stay alive?
John, they haunted you...
They might past.
No body is haunted by their past.
Well, goodbye.
John, I' il talk to the department.
Maybe in the spring.
Hey, Nash.
You' re... scared?
Terrify, modify, petrify, stupidfy by you.
Thanks, professor.
Goodbye.
Have a nice day.
See you.
Professor Nash.
Can you see him?
Ya.
Are you sure?
How is he?
Forgive me.
I' m Just always suspicious in old people.
See you next week, professor.
See you next week.
Who are you and what can I do for you?
Professor, my name is Thomas King.
Look at me.
I' m Just a little stun.
Over the past few years, your equal liberty has become a corner stone of modern economics.
Suddenly everybody Just about to like that one.
What about my work in some other proJect?
Some mathematic?
The application of your bargaining problem to F. C. C. banned with auctions or to any trust cases...
Trust cases?
Yes.
I never would have princip on that.
I Just lead some honesty to some stupidity.
No, you haven' t.
I would never had thought about that.
Shall we have tea?
I usually Just take my sandwich in the library.
Come on, John.
Let' s have some tea.
It' s a big day.
Most commercial have my tea in the palette.
There was some northern lndian tea, that I enJoyed the flavour...
I have not been in this room for quite so many years...
Things are certainly change around here.
I have a son that age.
I thought the receivers of the Nobel Prize is to be secreted.
I thought you won' t have find out if you have won or lost.
That is generally the case, but this is circumstances.
The award is Just substantial.
They require private funding as such... the image of the Nobel...
Oh I see.
You come here Just to find out if I' m crazy.
Find out if I' il screw out everything that I actually want.
Strip naked like a chicken thing pours around the nature.
Something like that, yes.
But I embarass you.
Yes, it is possible.
You see...
I take medications.
I still see things that is not real.
I Just choose not to acknowledge.
I choose not to and indulge certain appetites.
Like my appetite to patterns.
Perhaps my appetite to imagine, to dream.
Professor Nash.
It' s good to have you here, John.
It' s an honour, sir.
Thank you very much.
A privilege, professor.
Thank you.
Thank you there.
That is most certainly unexpected.
Thank you.
I' ve always believe in numbers.
ln equations, and logics that lead to reasons.
I asked, what truly is logic.
Who decides its reason.
My quests has take them in to the physical, the mental physical, the delusional and back.
And I' ve made the most important discovery of my career.
The most important discovery of my life.
That any logical reasons can be found.
And I am only hitted because of you.
You are the reason I am.
You are all my reasons.
Thank you.
I' il call for the car, dad.
Oh yes, I am.
Yes, indeed.
Yes, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
What is it?
What' s wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Come with me, young lady.
I got mine off last year.
Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.
You know, I still got to wear my mouth guard.
You have really nice teeth.
Well, thank you.
And you have a pretty smile.
Custodial to cafeteria.
No, I mean it.
I really think those braces look good on you.
Thank you.
You' re welcome.
Brenda.
Yeah.
Do you know if they' re hiring here at the hospital?
I' m not sure.
What do you want to do?
I' m a doctor.
I' ve decided to get off the road for awhile.
I' ve taken a night job at a hospital and met some really nice people.
Feels good to have my feet on the ground to wake up in the same bed every night.
Who knows, maybe I' il even find someone to settle down with.
Harvard Medical school... top of your class. southern California Children' s Hospital.
Well, that' s a pretty impressive resume, Dr. Conners but unfortunately, uh... the only thing I need is a... an emergency room supervisor for my midnight to:: 00am shift someone to baby- sit six interns and 20 nurses but, uh...
Hell, I doubt that, uh, you would be interested in that.
Well, in the past they' ve always let me choose my own nurses.
Dr. Connelly?
Dr. Harris?
Present.
Dr. Ashland?
Dr. Conners...
You gonna take roll every night?
Uh, yes, I will, Dr. Ashland and if you' re going to be late, I suggest you bring a note.

30 milligrams of codeine every four hours.
Run the plasma at 60 drops a minute until we calculate the fluid requirements.

I concur.
Let' s get him up to Pediatrics.
Nurse Hopp to the Nurses' station south.
Hello, Brenda.
Hi, Dr. Conners.
You need to sign these.
Thank you.
Do you notice anything different about me, Doctor?
- You got your braces off!
Come here.
I' ve been trying to show you all night!
Good job.
Mine felt so weird after.
Mm, I keep rubbing my tongue over them.

They' re so slippery.
It feels good, though, doesn' t it?
Yeah, it feels incredible.
Oh, my.

No, no.
They have a staff doctor in the emergency ward.
What if he' s in surgery?
Do you really think I have to go?
Oh.
In here, Dr. Conners.
Gentlemen, what, uh... what seems to be the problem?
Bicycle accident.
- Dr. Harris.
- Yes?
Do you concur?
C...
Concur with what, sir?
With what Dr. Ashland just said.
Do you...
Do you concur?
Uh... well, it was a bicycle accident.
Um, the boy told us. so you concur?
Uh...
I think we should take an X ray then stitch him up and put him in a walking cast.
That' s very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.
Well, you don' t seem to have much need for me.
Carry on.
I blew it, didn' t I?
Why didn' t I concur?
Dr. Henning, extension 219.
Make yourself at home!
You' re not a cop. special Agent Hanratty, FBl.
You' re not a cop.
My landlord said you were not a cop.
Well, if you' re going to arrest me
I' d like to put on a different suit if that' s okay with you.
No, no, I' m not here to arrest you.
He' s in trouble.
Do you know where he is?
If I tell you where he is will you promise not to tell his mother? sure.
Frank made up a fake I. D. and enlisted in the Marine Corps.
He' s over in Vietnam right now.
That kid is halfway around the world crawling through the damn jungle fighting the Communists, so... please, don' t come to my home and call my boy a criminal because that kid has more guts...
I never said he was a criminal, Mr. Abagnale.
I said he was in trouble.
If you' d like to give me a call and talk, here' s my number.
You' re not a father, are you?
Pardon me?
If you were a father, you' d know.
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.
Yes, sir.
I understand. sean, sean, now get this:
"Riverbend Apartments 415 Landover, Atlanta, Georgia."
Atlanta, Georgia.
Yeah, I' m on my way to the airport.
I' il meet the team in, uh, in four hours.
Bye- bye.
You don' t have to cry.
I' m sorry.
I' m so sorry, Frank.
I can' t do this.
Brenda, listen to me.
I don' t care if you' re a virgin, all right?
I' m not a virgin.
I had an abortion two years ago.
My parents had a friend do it a man that my father plays golf with.
And then, when I got better, they kicked me out of the house.
I had an abortion and I wasn' t their daughter anymore.
I' m so sorry.
Please don' t be mad at me.
Please, please, don' t be mad at me.
No, no.
Now... what if... what if I spoke to your parents, right?
May- Maybe I can straighten things out, huh?
Well, I ask them all the time but they said I still can' t come home.
Brenda... what if you were engaged to a doctor?
Will that change anything?
What?
What if I went to your parents... and I spoke to your father...
and I asked permission to marry you?
It' s empty.
Nobody here.
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?
Yes, I- I am a Lutheran, but, please, call me Frank.
Frank, would you like to say grace?
Unless you' re not comfortable.
Absolutely.
Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.
The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned but the second mouse, he struggled so hard that he eventually churned that cream into butter and he walked out.
- Amen.
Amen.
Oh, that was beautiful.
The mouse, he churned that cream into butter.
That' s pretty good.
Thank you.
Well, um, to be quite honest
I' m thinking about getting back into law.
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?
Before I went to medical school, I passed the bar in California.
I practiced law for one year then I decided why not try my hand at pediatrics?
Yeah.
A doctor and a lawyer.
Well, I' d say that Brenda hit the jackpot.
Where did you go to law school?
Uh, Berkeley.
Berkley, Berkley.
Isn' t that where you went, Daddy?
Maybe Frank could come work for you, Roger.
You' re always saying how hard it is to find Assistant Prosecutors.
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?
Could he come work with you, please?
Was that snake Hollingsworth still teaching there when you went through Berkley?
Yes.
Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right?
I tell you.
Meaner than ever.
And that dog of his?
Uh...
How unfortunate.
A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran... so what are you, Frank?
'Cause I think you' re about to ask for my daughter' s hand in marriage and I have a right to know.
Know what, sir?
The truth.
Tell me the truth, Frank.
What are you doing here?
What is a man like you doing with Brenda?
If you want my blessing if you want my daughter
I' d like to hear it from you now.
The truth is, sir, that...
I' m not a doctor, I' m not a lawyer...
I' m not an airline pilot.
I' m nothing, really.
I' m- I' m- I' m just a kid who' s in love with your daughter.
No.
You know what you are?
You' re a romantic.
Men like us are nothing without the women we love.
I must confess, I' m guilty of the same foolish whimsy.
I proposed to Carol after five dates with two nickels in my pockets and holes in my shoes because I knew she was the one. so go ahead, Frank.
Don' t be afraid.
sir, uh, uh... w- what would I have to do to take the bar here in New Orleans?
No, the... the other question.
Right through that door.
Good luck, Mr. Conners.
Thank you.
Hey, Frank... you know what I could never figure out?
Why?
What' s the difference? someone else took the test for you, didn' t they?
Carl, I' m going to prison for a long time. seriously, what' s the difference?
It' s a simple question.
Are you going to eat that eclair?
Yeah.
I' m saving it for later.
Well, you want to split it with me?
No.
Give me half that eclair and I' il tell you.
I' m going to figure it out sooner or later.
You' il be working under Phillip Rigby in corporate law.
Thank you.
We' re having lunch at 12: 30 with the Attorney General and Governor McKeithen.
The Governor.
Did we spell it right?
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome aboard.
Now...
Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart.
It' s a photograph of Prentice York where they found him, dead.
Now, here is an enlargement of part of that photograph.
This is a photograph of the defendant' s signature on a canceled check.
Now, here is an enlargement of that same signature which matches the signature on the letters that he wrote to Mrs. Simon which discuss the possibility of defrauding the great state of Louisiana.
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is irrefutable evidence that the defendant is, in fact, lying.
There is no... defendant.
- Is that Mitch?
Roger!
It' s Mitch!
Won' t you join them and the gang in a few songs for the Irish?
Everybody!
K, E, double L, Y
Has anybody here seen Kelly?

Now they want the crumbs.

They' re trying to scare me, intimidate me.
You know what?

'Cause she... she' s going to the wedding with us.
I' m going to get you a brand- new suit, Dad.
I' m getting you a brand- new suit.
One of those Manhattan Eagle, three- button, black pearl suits.
Those are nice.
Yeah. she won' t see me.
Uh- uh.

Dad, why don' t you call her right now?
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.
I have two first- class tickets to go see her son' s wedding...
Your mother' s married now, to my friend Jack Barnes.

I had an FBI agent come see me.
The guy looked scared.
Pow!
Dad... it' s over.
I' m going to stop now.
But y- you' ve...
They' re never going to catch you, Frank.
- Dad, she wouldn' t do that.

- Why would she do that to you?
- Come on, sit.
Have a drink.

Then ask me to stop.
Then ask me to stop.
You can' t stop.

What do you want?
Okay.
Uh...
I want it to be over.
I' m getting married.
You know, I' m settling down.
You' ve stolen almost $4 million.
You think we can just call that a wedding present?
Nah, this isn' t something you get to walk away from, Frank.
No truce.
You will be caught, you will go to prison.
Where did you think this was going?
Please leave me alone, Carl.
Please?
I' m getting close, aren' t I?
You' re scared because I' m getting close.

You want to run, be my guest.

Frank, where' d you get all that money?
Brenda, listen.

A name, it doesn' t matter.
My name is Frank Conners, right?

But- but we all have secrets.
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That- That' s my secret.
- Frank Taylor?!
- Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?
- Frank Black.
- Frank Black?!
Yeah, it doesn' t matter.
Why are you saying all this?
Brenda...
Brenda, I don' t want to lie to you anymore.
All right?
I never went to medical school.
I' m not a lawyer or a Harvard graduate or a Lutheran.
Brenda, I ran away from home a year and a half ago when I was 16.
Frank...
Frank?
You' re not a Lutheran?
Brenda... you see all this money?
You see all this money?
I have more.
I have plenty more.

Brenda...
Why would you lie to me?

I- I think they went upstairs.
Frank...:
Brenda, come here.
Okay, in two days, you' re going to meet me at Miami International Airport, all right?
You' re going to take a taxicab.
You give the taxi driver this money right here and you tell him to drive all through the night.
Brenda, you' re going to leave at 10: 00am.
- 10: 00am, all right?
Till I get to the top...
Which room, sir?
You have to listen to me, all right?
The International Terminal in Miami, all right?
Say it.
Okay, the International Terminal in Miami.
- No matter what...

- I will take a taxi.
You' re going to be there at 10: 00am.
Two days, Brenda.
Two days.
In two days, I' il be there no matter what, at 10: 00am.
You' re not going to tell anyone, Brenda.
Frank, please!
Before you go, please tell me your name.
Please, tell me.
Frank William Abagnale Jr.
Brenda.
He must' ve got wise to us.
Maybe he was tipped.
We' il get him before he leaves the country.
He doesn' t have a passport.
For the last six months, he' s gone to Harvard and Berkeley.
I' m betting he can get a passport. so we have all our men waiting for him here in Miami International.
He' s used it before.
He knows the layout.
I talked to Miami police; they' ve offered us 50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25.
With our guys, that' s almost 100 men in one airport.
Don' t you think we should spread it around?
No, no, this is the exit point.
Well, how do you know he hasn' t rented a car and driven to airports in New York, Atlanta?
Because I' m not in New York.
I' m not in Atlanta.
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts and I' m letting all the universities in the area know that Pan Am will be initiating a new recruiting program this year.
I' Il, uh, be stopping by your campus tomorrow morning.
At the end of the day
I' il be choosing eight young ladies to be a part of...... Pan Am' s future stewardess flight crew program.
Now, these eight young ladies will accompany me on a two- month public relations tour through Europe.
They will discover firsthand what it takes to be a Pan American stewardess.
Nah, one man per every two counters.
- All right?
Yeah?
Hey... let' s have, uh, periodic sweeps of the men' s lav.
You, here.
What qualifies me to be a future stewardess?
Well, I think that I' m really friendly and I can really help out and, um, make people feel welcome on the plane and...
All my bags are packed, I' m ready to go...
Miggy Acker.
Debra Jo McMillan.
Come fly with me, let' s fly, let' s fly away
There' s a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let' s fly, let' s fly away
You see that blonde out front?
Exactly.
Hanratty.
Carl, your walkie- talkie wasn' t working.
There' s a guy in a Pan Am uniform sitting in a white Coupe DeVille out in front of Terminal J.
That' s the charter terminal.
Can you get a look at his face?
He' s got his pilot' s cap on.
Carl, I think it' s him!... Just say the words, and we' il beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay...
Watch out, watch out, watch out!... It' s perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say...
Out of the car, Frank.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Don' t shoot me!
I' m just a driver.
A man paid me $100 to wear this uniform and pick someone up at the airport.
Who you picking up?
Hey!
Pack up, let' s fly away.
Singapore, Egypt.
The kid' s gone completely out of control.
Why wasn' t I called?
The banks didn' t know what was happening till last week.
That' s impossible.
They didn' t call 'cause it' s not counterfeiting.
- It' s something else.
- Well, what is he doing?
He' s making real checks, sir.
These are so perfect the airline didn' t know the difference.
Last check was cashed in Madrid a week ago.
My guess is he' s still there.
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.
Go where? spain?
You want to go to spain?
Well, eventually, he' s got to go back to where the checks were printed.
I think that' s why he' s moving back through Europe.
Look at the map, sir.
He' s making a circle.
He' s running out of checks.
I know it' s a... it' s a long shot, sir but if we track him from Madrid, sir, we could still catch him.
I' m sorry, Carl, if you couldn' t catch him here you' re not going to catch him there.
But, sir, we' re going to let him get away.
No, Carl, you let him get away.
A perfect one- 16th all the way around.
Color separation is flawless.
There' s no bleeding.
Nobody does work like this in the states.
Nobody but us.
Where was it printed?
It was printed on a monster...
A monster.... a Heidelberg, an Istra...
Heidelberg.... a dinosaur, four colors.
You can smell the weight.
Two tons, without the ink.
Where do they do printing like this?
Germany, Great Britain...
France.
France.
Frank' s mother said the name of a village in France where they didn' t have sara Lee.
The village where she met Frank' s father.
Oh, yeah, I don' t remember, uh...
Question:
"Yes, I lived in a small village in France.
Yeah, right.
"The kind of place where they never heard of sara Lee."
Natum videte
Venite...
Carl!
Merry Christmas!
How is it that we' re always talking on Christmas, Carl?
Every Christmas I' m talking to you!
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You' re under arrest.
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?
Here, give these a try.
There' s two dozen French police officers outside.
Carl, I gotta tell you, they' re delicious.
You want a bite?
But they needed the help of an American.
You want a bite?
But I told them I wouldn' t bring them to you unless I could put the cuffs on you myself.
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?
- No.
No gun.
And- and you' re... and you' re telling me what?
There' s, uh, there' s uh... there' s two dozen French police officers out there right now on Christmas Eve?
That' s what you' re telling me?
Yeah.
Well, there' s no windows here.
I' m going to take a look out the front door.
No!
No!
I told them I' d walk out first and give a signal.
Here, you can put these on yourself.
No, I can' t do that!
I can' t do that.
You know why?
I don' t...
I think...
I think it' s just me and you.
That' s right.
I think it' s just me and you, and you know what?
You' re going to have to catch me yourself!
I wo... we don' t have time for this.
Ah, that' s good.
Tell me what you want me to see, huh?
I wouldn' t lie to you.
Look, you' re wearing a wedding ring.
You' re wearing a wedding ring, Carl!
You lied to me about that!
You asked me if I had a family.
I did, but I don' t anymore.
Yes?
No, no, no, there is no problem.
We' re coming out right now.
That was good.
What, did you... you pay some hotel desk clerk to make that call for you, is that what you did?
It was Captain Luc.
I' ve got one minute to bring you out.
Captain Luc!
Ooh, Captain Luc.
Well, Carl, I gotta say that- that sounds pretty official to me but like I said, I...
I think it' s just me and you here, it' s me and you. so you' re going to have to catch me.
Frank!
You have to trust me on this!
These people have been embarrassed, Frank.
You rob their banks, you steal their money you live in their country.
I told you this was what was going to happen that there was no other way for it to end.
Don' t make a mistake!
That' s good.
That' s good, Carl, you know?
Keep pushing it.
Keep pushing till you make it true.
They' re going to kill you!
You walk out that door, they' re going to kill you.
You have any children, Carl?
I have a four- year- old daughter.
You swear on your daughter?
You swear?
That was really good, Carl.
I have him in custody.
I got him!
It' s all right!
I got him!
I want it on the record.
Frank Abagnale surrendered of his own accord.
Understood?
Understood?
I' m...
Where are you taking him?
Let me in the...
Hey!
Gloria...
Don' t worry, Frank!
Gloria
Carl, you have to remember to let me call my father when we land.
I just want to, I want to talk to him before he sees me on television or something like that.
That' s LaGuardia right there.
Runway 4- 4.
Frank, your father is dead.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t want to say anything till we got closer to home.
He- He...
He fell down some steps at Grand Central station trying to catch a train.
I didn' t want to be the one to tell you.
You' re lying, right?
You said I could talk to him.
Carl, who are you to... who are you to say something like that, huh?
You said I could talk to him.
He fell, and he... and he broke his neck.
Goddamn it!
- It' s all right.
Carl, I got to go to the bathroom.
I' m going to be sick. sure.
Let' s go in the bathroom.
Goddamn it!
You' il have take your seat, sir.
I' ve told you twice.
We' re landing.
- All of you.
Come on now.
- We' re landing in six minutes.
- With your seat belts fastened.
- Frank, open the door!
- You do it.
FBl.
Stay seated.
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Everybody knows
Help to make the season bright
To see if reindeer really know how to fly...
Hands behind your head!... To you.
Carl, get me in the car, please.
Get me in the car.
Put him in.
Taking into account the gravity of these crimes your history of bold and elusive behavior and your complete lack of respect for the laws of the United States
I have no choice but to ignore your request to be treated as a minor and sentence you to 12 years in Atlanta' s maximum security prison and recommend strongly that you be kept in isolation for the entirety of that sentence.... "Merry Christmas to you."
I think about them all the time.
Merry Christmas, Frank.
Hey, I got you some comic books here.
How' s your daughter?
What was her name?
I don' t know. she lives with her mother in Chicago and I don' t get to see her much.
What' s in the briefcase?
I' m on my way to the airport.
Aw, geez, he' s... he' s driving us crazy.
You got any of the checks?
Yeah, yeah, I got a... a counterfeit that he drew on the Great Lakes savings and Loan. see, he' s just using a stencil machine and an Underwood.
Yeah, it' s a teller at the bank. say again?
I- It' s definitely a teller, Carl.
I mean, banks, they always use hand- stamps for the dates, see.
They get used over and over again so they always get worn out and the numbers are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines... see, they go first.
Thanks.
I' d like you to take a look at something for me.
Tell me what you think.
That' s a fake.
How do you know?
You haven' t looked at it.
Well, there' s no perforated edge, right?
I mean, this... this check was hand- cut, not fed.
Yeah...
Paper is double- bonded much too heavy to be a bank check.
Magnetic ink, it' s, uh, raised against my fingers instead of flat.
And this doesn' t smell like MlCR.
It' s some kind of a... you know, some kind of a drafting ink.
You know, the kind you get at a stationery store.
Frank... would you be interested in working with the FBl' s Financial Crimes Unit?
I already got a job here.
You know, I, uh, deliver the mail.
Frank, we have the power to take you out of prison.
You' d be placed in the custody of the FBI where you' d serve out the remainder of your sentence as an employee of the federal government.
Hi.
I- I' m Frank Abagnale.
I' m supposed to start work here today.
It' s a tour company operating out of the BVl. sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.
I' m going to call you back.
Hello, Carl.
Welcome to the FBl.
I' il show you where you' re working.
Carl... how long do I have to work here?
It' s:: 15 in the morning to 5: 00 in the afternoon.
45 minutes for lunch.
No, I...
Every day.
Every day, Frank, till we let you go.
- Hi.
How you doing?
It' s not a good time, Frank.
I' m clearing my desk for the weekend.
Carl, you mind if I come to work with you tomorrow?
Tomorrow is saturday.
I' il be back to work on Monday.
You' re going to see Grace, huh?
Well, that' s the plan.
so what should I do till Monday?
Excuse me.
This is Hanratty.
Oh, yeah, put him on.
Mr. Sawyer.
How are you?
American Airlines 355 serving Chicago and san Francisco is now open for passenger check- in.
How' d you do it, Frank?
How' d you pass the bar in Louisiana?
What are you doing here?
Listen...
I' m sorry I put you through all this.
You go back to Europe, you' re gonna die in Perpignan Prison.
You try to run here in the states we' il send you back to Atlanta for 50 years.
I know that.
I spent four years trying to arrange your release.
Had to convince my bosses at the FBI and the Attorney General of the United states you wouldn' t run.
Why' d you do it?
You' re just a kid.
I' m not your kid.
You said you were going to Chicago.
My daughter can' t see me this weekend. she' s going skiing.
You said she was four years old.
You' re lying. she was four when I left.
Now she' s 15.
My wife' s been remarried for 11 years.
I see Grace every now and again.
I don' t understand. sure you do. sometimes it' s easier living the lie.
I' m going to let you fly tonight, Frank.
I' m not even going to try to stop you.
That' s' cause I know you' il be back on Monday.
Yeah?
Look.
Passengers with boarding passes, please proceed to Gate 23A.
Alice, has he still not called?
No, he hasn' t.
Good morning.
I' ve, uh, called this meeting to discuss a new type of check fraud and counterfeiting which the unsub is washing and altering checks then passing them throughout Arizona.
This unsub is a big dog passing checks as large as five figures.
sorry I' m late. sorry.
We have a recovered check on Agent Reiter' s desk.
Why don' t we step out to the bullpen?
There' s impressions on every line.
Looks like the original amount was for $60.
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.
Cost the bank $16, 000.
Yeah.
It' s been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.
I mean...
I mean, this isn' t hydrochloride or bleach.
No. something new.
Maybe a nail polish remover where the acetone removes the ink that' s not been printed?
How did you do it, Frank?
How did you cheat on the bar exam in Louisiana?
I didn' t cheat.
I studied for two weeks and I passed.
Is that the truth, Frank?
Is that the truth?
I' il bet this guy steals checks out of mailboxes.
You' re saying that he' s a local?
Well, if it were me, you know
I' d call the bank first, I' d check out the balance...
Exactly.
You know, Carl, I think this guy' s pretty smart.
I guess all we have to do now is catch him.
We' il start first thing in the morning.
We' il run the name Eric Anthony Feeders.
In Nevada, Arizona, California.
Yeah...
They' re fighting again!
Don' t!
Not my homework!
No!
Stop it!
No!
Problem, gentlemen?
Hey, dork- brain!
If you weren' t a girl, I' d beat your face off.
If you weren' t a girl, I' d beat your face off.
You' re calling me a girl?
You called me one!
You asked for it.
Now get out of here!
Forget those guys.
They' re just jealous because you' re smart and funny.
What girls?
Lots of girls.
I mean... I like you.
I don' t like you.
Now everybody thinks I need a girl to fight for me.
You are a dork- brain.
My nose!
Wimp!
Moe and Larry in the house.
Grant, what have we got out back?
All clear, sir.
Matthews, what do you got?
Returnable cans, sir.
I' m up to 75 cents.
Hey, we got a cab.
Here comes Curly.
The Three Stooges.
Check it out, Ivan' s packing.
Thank you!
We' ve got a briefcase.
Hart, waiting for visual confirmation.
No disc yet.
Suitcase is opening.
This woman' s ass is in the way.
We need to see the discs.
- This broad' s got two asses!
- Do something!
Excuse me.
You wanting something else?
Yeah.
I really love this borscht.
Or, as they say in Russian:
We got the discs.
We' re moving in!
Get down!
Keep your hands where I can see them!
No English.
Nobody moves until I see some goddamn "Lazhitsa na pol"!
Sir, he' s turning purple!
Hart, until we secure, you stay.
That is one really, really purple Russian, sir!
He' s still armed!
Nobody moves!
Hands up!
Back off!
He' s not gonna die.
He' s not good enough for that.
His victims didn' t get a chance to choke on a peanut, did they, sir?
Now you' re going down.
Drop the guns or I' il kill her.
Ivan, out the back.
You' re not killing anyone.
Party' s over!
How' s your head, my little piroshki?
This is gonna put you away for a long time.
Let' s get that ambulance in here!
- Shut up!
- Stay with me!
- I' m sorry.
- Don' t be sorry.
You did a great job!
Nice work.
See you back there.
Come on, Hart.
The van' s waiting.
I got Grant shot.
I shouldn' t have moved.
Come on, you made a choice.
It was wrong, but that' s it.
It' s over.
By the way, you look like hell.
- Morning, Mrs. Schwartz.
- Good morning, Gracie.
Hart.
Yes, sir.
ETA, 20 minutes.
No problem.
Breakdown?
Yes, sir.
Negative.
Do not need assistance.
Ten- four.
Yes, sir, I know it' s hot.
Hey, you cannot park --
It' s an emergency.
Official business.
Aside, please.
Thank you.
Official business.
Step aside.
Hey, get lost!
I' m waiting here.
FBl.
Excuse me.
Sir, ma' am, please back off.
I need eight double- tall --
Eight double- tall lattes.
One with no foam.
Five decaf lattes with a long straw.
Four caramel macchiattos.
Double up on the cup.
Two blueberry scones with the little granules on top...... and one Starbucks compilation CD.
No!
I would like....
What' s going on?
Where' s McDonald?
Could we put out an APB on my Frappuccino?
It' s in the bag.
Did he say anything about last night?
Don' t annoy him.
Don' t say anything.
Don' t argue.
I don' t argue.
I never argue.
When do I argue?
I might have a heated discussion with somebody.
Is this you not arguing?
Morning, sir.
It' s....
Sir.
Okay, everybody.
I know you' re all concerned about Grant' s condition.
So I' m happy to report...... Jerry' s gonna be fine.
He' il be out of the hospital in two weeks.
He says he' s expecting lots of gifts.
So much for the good news.
We got another letter from the Citizen.
Arson, explosives, poison...... this guy never works the same way twice.
The only thing we know for sure...... is, we get these letters full of incomprehensible riddles...... he strikes and suddenly the clues make sense.
This one is down in Intelligence.
Hopefully, we' il get a lead before somebody gets killed.
In the meantime...... Matthews, get a team together.
Sir, you want me to take point?
For five years you' ve wanted it.
Last night, you earned it.
I want preliminaries by 3.
That' s it.
Sir...?
Who' s buying me lunch?
Sir, I would like to talk about what happened last night.
I didn' t exactly follow orders --
There' s no such thing.
You follow orders or you don' t.
No arguments, sir.
None whatsoever.
Until the hearing, you' re out of the field.
The hearing is totally warranted.
Wouldn' t I be better on the Citizen case?
I have a background in profiling and decoding.
I could contribute.
Like you contributed last night?
By putting yourself and 5 agents in jeopardy?
You will bury yourself under a mountain of paperwork.
Discussion is over.
Rough day?
The worst.
Sure you want a whole one?
Hit me big time, baby.
Hey, Einstein.
If you figure out that Citizen letter, let me know.
Congratulations on the op.
It' s a big shot.
Thanks.
How are you doing?
You okay?
You' re starting early today.
Yeah, I' m gonna get chip- faced.
I' d love to, but I have a pressing social engagement.
Beth!
Brownie meeting.
Mike, give me a beer and....
Milk.
Give her milk.
White wine spritzer.
Are most of the people in here agents?
As a matter of fact, here' s an agent.
Gracie Hart.
Beth Carter.
Right back to you.
Beth is an undergrad at Vassar, doing a paper on law enforcement.
I' m helping her get an inside look.
I bet she' il do the same for you.
Gracie, I would love to get a woman' s point of view.
You' re barking up the wrong tree.
Right, Hart?
Do all the women have to wear those really masculine shoes?
I get these made special by the guy that put the tattoo on my ass.
We' il leave you with Ben and Jerry.
Catch you later.
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.
Hope you have a good time at the mall.
Wohop is the place.
Wohop is good, but if you like variety, you go to La Chinita Linda.
Their rice and beans are slamming.
I don' t want variety.
I get pork fried rice every --
I figured it out!
I tried to create a content- based pattern...... similar to his previous letters.
But this time, he used a signifier.
In this case, the word "miss"...... in the subsequent letters.
Will you let me finish?
It' s the Miss United States Pageant.
Intelligence thought so too.
What do we got?
Miss United States from San Antonio, Texas, home of the Alamo.
I forgot the Alamo.
The pageant lasts three days.
Preliminaries, conferences...... the live telecast.
It' s a logistical nightmare.
Not just a babe- fest.
Jesus, we' ve only got 48 hours.
Okay, gentlemen.
Where do we start?
Set up a meeting.
Because you' il probably need their cooperation.
Yeah, I can do that.
What about jurisdiction?
The Citizen has been ours from the start.
You might want to call San Antonio.
Grease some wheels so they like us...... when we need manpower and tech.
While I' m at it, let' s do that.
Good idea.
He loves to make a splash.
His target will be public...... like one of these outdoor prelims or a TV broadcast.
Telecasters at the convention center.
We' re gonna need surveillance on the interior perimeter.
We' il need more.
There' s a million places...... only these bikini- stuffers can go: backstage areas, hotel rooms....
We need to get somebody in there.
Yeah!
Now I' m thinking...... undercover.
Good idea, boss.
I got just the girl.
That' s nothing.
Check this out.
Compliments of my daughter: the "Dress Up Sally" web site.
What did I tell you?
Hot, right?
You got a little problem.
She' s perfect!
Look to the left.
Down... down....
- There you go.
- "On maternity leave"?
That' s not gonna work.
Not unless it' s "The Miss Lamaze Pageant."
Female field agents under 35.
Jensen, Jensen!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got it, I got it!
Oh, no!
That' s right, that' s right!
Check this out.
I got the winner right here.
Scorekeepers ready?
This is the best part.
He' s right behind me, isn' t he?
Not really my color, is it?
Sir, we were just...... looking for someone to go undercover at the pageant.
And I' m the best we have.
It doesn' t inspire much confidence.
Get back to work.
- Hart, shouldn' t you be at a desk?
- Yes, sir.
You don' t say anything?
Made me look like an idiot.
Do I have eyes in the back of my head?
- He was standing right behind me.
- What were we gonna say?
- What?
- This one.
Are you kidding?
It' s Hart.
Cut it off.
Let' s go back to work.
Hold on.
That' s not bad.
Hold on, nothing.
Hit the save button because you won' t see that again.
- What do you say?
- No freaking way.
Why not?
I won' t parade around in a swimsuit like some bimbo...... named Gracie Lou Freebush, and all she wants is world peace.
It wouldn' t be like that.
You' d be on the undercover team.
In a thong.
In a tasteful one- piece!
You know what?
Pull this off.
Is it because McDonald hates me?
Or is it, like, a woman thing?
Don' t kid yourself.
Nobody thinks of you that way.
He' s punishing me, isn' t he?
That' s right.
Like it or not, you screwed up, pal.
Sit down, sit down.
I' ve never been in a beauty pageant.
I don' t even own a brush.
Which part of that is supposed to shock me?
Let' s suspend reality for a second...... and pretend I said yes.
I got to do everything?
Like...... the whole big hair and the makeup and --
Damn right.
The spinning, the twirling, the smiling, the cute little tap number.
Hundred bucks on Matthews.
I don' t know.
She' s got rage.
I' il take that bet.
Yeah, baby.
So you' re saying...... I have to wear the bathing suit?
You go, girl.
Where am I gonna put my gun?
No place I want to know about.
What could possibly motivate anybody to enter a beauty pageant?
Scholarship money, a chance to see the world...... broaden your horizons --
So join the Marines.
It' s like feminism never even happened.
Any woman that does this is catering to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality.
Can you really be this superficial?
Hard to believe, right?
Therefore, we' d like to use one of our team undercover.
Am I hearing this correctly?
Kathy, these people want to put one of their agents...... in the pageant.
They want her to win?
No, ma' am.
We will need your help with the judging...... so our agent is in the top five...... to have access to all the areas at all times.
- Absolutely not.
- Miss Morningside...... we understand how important this beauty pageant --
Excuse me.
This is not a beauty pageant.
This is a scholarship program.
And it has been ever since my reign.
I fully intend on maintaining that credo.
Absolutely, Miss Morningside.
We' re here to protect the girls.
Women.
Scholarship ladies.
There' s nothing more important to me than the safety of my girls.
I' d rather cancel the pageant than have them blown up.
Especially without their knowledge.
We went to the network to cancel, but they refused.
I' m confused.
What state is she going to be from?
All the winners have been chosen.
We recently discovered some information about Miss New Jersey.
And her performance in a little film called Arma Get It On.
Was that her?
Oh, yeah!
She was gonna drop out pretty soon, if you know what I mean.
Do you have an agent in mind?
Let me get you Victor Melling' s number.
Frank.
He' s our pageant consultant.
Frank.
Maybe he can do something to help.
Frank!
This is my assistant, Frank Tobin.
Hi, everyone.
Would you get these people Victor' s number, please?
And get me a spring water.
And for God' s sake, tuck in your shirt.
That, that was... a water for you...... and....
Victor Melling' s number.
Mr. Melling.
How are you?
If you are Grace Hart, I quit here and now.
I' m having a bad hair day.
Bad hair decade, really.
I' m Eric Matthews.
We spoke.
Your hair is perfect.
However, I can' t accept this job.
There' s no way on Earth I can make this woman ready in two days.
Please, Mr. Melling, give it a chance.
Sit down.
Totally on the Bureau.
I suppose that would be the civilized thing to do.
Actually, I' m gonna take a rain check.
I got a lot of FBI stuff I' ve got to take care of.
That thing I told you about that I gotta do.
But I' il see you later.
We' il hang out.
You like caps?
I' il get you an official FBI cap.
See you later.
What a pity.
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
It is always "yes," never "yeah." Sit down.
Do you understand?
Watch the hands, garçon.
- Excuse me.
- It' s all right.
I have a feeling we' re going to need a drop cloth later.
Could I have another cabernet sauvignon?
- I' m good, thanks.
- That' s okay, Philip.
So, how long have you been doing this pageant- training thing?
I' m sorry?
What was the question?
I was distracted by a half- masticated cow...... rolling around in your wide- open trap.
What is your problem?
- Problem?
- Yeah.
I mean, yes.
Have I offended you in some way?
You' ve been completely antagonistic to me from the second I walked in.
I was once the most sought- after, highly paid...... consultant in pageant history.
I had no idea.
Every season, girls would plead with me to train them.
Ten out of 11 years...... my girls were crowned.
The year we lost, the winner was a deaf- mute.
You can' t beat that.
Then...... in '96...... my girl froze like a puddle halfway through her aria from La Bohème.
Afterwards, she told a reporter from Pageant Magazine...... that I was a perfectionist...... who had harangued her to within an inch of her sanity.
Of course, after that article came out...... nobody wanted me.
With all due respect here...... why did Miss Morningside suggest you?
Because I am the best.
Or perhaps it' s because everyone else worth having had a contestant.
They had their Southern belles, their Midwestern farmers' daughters.
Spunky Western cowgirls.
And I have...... Dirty Harriet.
Will you desist?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
I haven' t seen a walk like that since Jurassic Park.
It' s been working really well for me for the past 30 years, all right?
Well, glide, now.
Glide.
Don' t look down, don' t look down.
Don' t look down, look up.
Your chin should be parallel to the floor.
Now glide.
Glide.
It' s not the bloody Ice Capades.
Gliding.
No, no.
Don' t pick your feet up.
Why are you picking your feet up?
Because I' m preparing to run away.
No, wait.
Watch me.
Glide.
Glide.
It' s all in the buttocks.
Don' t I look pretty?
It takes a very secure man to walk like that.
Roll your hips.
Head up, head up.
Keep gliding --
I' m gliding here!
What are you, blind?
Asshole.
Look how she walks.
She' s floating.
Lightly ascending from cloud to cloud...... towards heaven.
He takes one look at that fake rack...... he' s gonna send her right back.
Look, she' s gonna cry again.
"If I only had a brain!"
I am somewhat less than amused.
How' s she doing?
With some intensive work...... she' il be ready for the world' s finest trailer park.
Thank you!
Both painful...... and grotesque.
Isn' t it?
Oh, my God!
Mr. Vic, we got everything you asked for.
Where do we start?
Teeth, hair, manicure, pedicure.
Which one first?
What are you gonna do to my teeth?
Hopefully, remove the beer stains and steak residue.
Can' t I get some Novocain?
It' s only a cleaning.
Sweeney Todd, what are you doing?
Your hair should make a statement.
As long as it' s not, "Thanks for the Country Music Award."
You' il be lucky if I can get it untangled.
Can I borrow that drill?
Attention.
Attention.
All hair removal units, wax, electrolysis, laser...... to commence at 2300 hours.
How you doing?
Ever seen one this big?
Sandwich, I mean.
That' s a lot of meat.
Thank you!
Nobody said this job was easy.
This earpiece lets you hear anybody on our frequencies.
With all this foil, I' m getting HBO.
This is a pin camera.
There' s an actual lens in there.
It provides a digital video feed to our hookups.
Pageant identity.
Gracie Lou Freebush?
I remembered you liked that.
Well, my IQ just dropped 10 points.
More... fluffy.
Eyebrows.
There should be two.
Unbelievable.
Where the hell is she?
What could possibly be taking this long?
Hart, is that you?
I' m in a dress, I have gel in my hair, I haven' t slept...... I' m starved and I' m armed.
Don' t mess with me.
I' m fine.
I' m cool.
I' m good.
Yeah, that' s her.
Mr. Vic, nice work!
Thank you.
My God, I' m good.
Okay, Gracie Lou, listen up.
"Operation Thong" has commenced.
Why don' t you stun- gun yourself?
Victor?
Try not to speak.
Victor!
Miss Morningside, if it' s possible...... you look more radiant than ever.
Then I guess it' s possible.
Hi.
Miss Hart?!
I mean, Miss Freebush.
Victor, I see you haven' t completely lost your touch.
You look absolutely perfect.
And you' re just in time for the orientation breakfast.
You' il take the bags to the room?
It' s been a while since you' ve been with us...... but you remember how everything goes.
One little mistake and I' m a bloody bellhop.
Ohio.
Oh- hi- yo!
Washington.
Original.
You come up with that all by yourself?
- Miss Greenbush!
I got it.
New Jersey?
Welcome.
- Who' s she?
- Have you seen her before?
Oh, hey, New Jersey?
This one' s empty.
Thanks.
- I' m Cheryl from Rhode Island.
- Hi, I' m --
Gracie Lou Freebush.
I memorized the orientation pamphlet.
I know all 49 ladies by name and picture.
Fifty, including myself.
Your picture wasn' t there, so I knew it was you from your lack of picture.
How about a little song for the drive?
I think you know the one I mean.
From sea to shining sea
Like Lady Liberty
She reigns over all she sees
She' s beauty and she' s grace
She' s Miss United States
Entering Barbie- town.
We' re up and running.
I love my job!
- Not a bad view.
- Not at all.
There' s our table!
I got here three days early so I could --
Look at all the hoochie mama!
Not the pastry!
Ladies, I would like you to meet Gracie Lou Freebush from New Jersey.
Karen Krantz, New York.
What' s up, Jersey?
- Mary Jo Wright, Texas.
- Hi there.
Belinda Brown, Tennessee.
- I like that!
- Oh, yeah!
Leslie Davis, California.
Hey, girl.
And Alana Krewson, Hawaii.
Aloha.
Aloha to you too!
I want you all to know, I believe what it says on the sign at the Alamodome.
We are all winners.
Hey, Hart!
You think she' s hungry?
Most important, we' re getting our issues out there for people to hear.
And it' s an honor to have made it this far.
Especially when you' re from a small state --
That' s so true!
- Us Rhode Islanders -- - I wasn' t finished.
Did it sound like I was?
I' m sorry.
Why are you apologizing to her?
She' s been drinking too much Coppertone.
- Are you talking to me?
Question:
In Hawaii, don' t you use "Aloha" for hello and goodbye?
So?
If you' re on the phone with someone who won' t stop talking...... and you say "aloha," don' t they start again?
At least she thinks I' m funny.
Hart?
Hart, do you copy?
- What' s up?
- I don' t know.
It' s not working.
- It worked five minutes ago.
- Who put it together?
Check one, check one --
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
For the past 21 years...... it has been my honor to serve as director of this pageant.
And I know that this year will be our most exciting event ever!
Couple of geniuses I' m working with.
After the rehearsal and a photo shoot, you can settle into your rooms.
Tomorrow we will begin the preliminaries...... hosted by our master of ceremonies...... an American institution, Stan Fields.
Thank you!
Oh, thank you, Kathy!
Get it back online!
- We' re working on it.
- We' re trying.
Thank you, Kathy.
Isn' t she ravishing?!
How does she do it?
I look in the mirror and say, "Who' s that old man in my pajamas?"
And even though I' il be retiring this year....
Well, don' t cry for me... Alabama.
That' s so sad.
He' s retiring.
He' s not retiring.
I spoke to him this morning, and he blurted it out.
They' re firing him, going for someone newer and younger.
I hope it' s Ricky Martin.
Jesus Christ!
I' m sorry.
I had a bite of my bagel and I forgot to pray.
Dear Jesus, please forgive me...... for not praying before I had a bite of my bagel and schmeer.
Thank you very much.
Amen.
I hope I' m not disturbing you.
Oh, no, I was just, you know...... grooming.
I made some of my famous hot chocolate.
My roommate' s asleep, or she' s starting to mold.
But do you want to come in?
I asked some of the other girls...... but when they heard "chocolate" they slammed their doors.
They didn' t give me a chance to say "nonfat."
Well, here' s to...... world peace.
World peace.
Hot.
I' m sorry.
I have to tell you...... I thought it was really great how you settled that argument today.
"Aloha, aloha."
That' s why you' re gonna win.
You' re so clever.
You should tell jokes for your talent.
What is your talent?
It' s -- It' s kind of like....
It' s, you know, it' s like a surprise.
But don' t worry, it' s nothing embarrassing.
Not anything like baton twirling or anything.
Oh, Cheryl, I' m sorry.
Twirling can be a real art.
I saw this cheerleader doing it at a football game.
She lit her batons on fire and did this sexy dance.
I wish I could do something like that.
My parents don' t like anything ostentatious.
And they really don' t like fire.
Cheryl, I think you have as good a chance as anyone to win.
You believe in yourself to have gotten this far, right?
- Really?
- Yeah.
You' re so nice and so smart and so sensitive.
You' re definitely gonna win.
That' s it.
I am in the middle of a REM cycle over here.
- Sorry.
- I' m sorry.
Not happening.
- What?
- You took your earpiece out.
- Vic needs you.
- Now?
- I haven' t slept in two days!
- I' il give you a cookie.
It better be a big one.
You don' t walk, you float.
Gently descending, you don' t look down.
Go back up and do it again.
Never, ever look down, okay?
Thighs touching....
- Touching, not clenching.
- I' m touching.
There' s a gap between knees and calves, your calves and your ankles.
Right now there' s a huge gap between my brain and my spinal cord.
Here.
What, no armored car?
That would be in my other dress.
What are you planning to do for your talent?
Sing?
Dance?
Chew with your mouth closed?
I' il do whatever you want, Yoda.
Oh, Lord.
Agent Matthews!
- This woman has no talent!
- Don' t shout it in front of her.
I can' t do so in the next five hours!
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
She' il be on- stage with nothing to do...... but convert oxygen into carbon dioxide!
You said you couldn' t make her pretty in two days, but she' s gorgeous.
Compared to the car wreck she was before.
My duties are stated in a contract, and I have fulfilled them.
- You talent her up by tomorrow or -- - Are you threatening me?
- Listen to me, you old fruitcake!
- How dare you, you cupcake!
There' s something I know how to do.
I haven' t done it since high school --
- You' re not having sex on this stage.
- I didn' t know it was an option.
This thing, I just have to call room service.
Miss Hart.
Please.
Thank you.
And the other one.
Thank you.
All right, all right, all right.
Happy, you doughnut Nazi?
Did I tell you Stan Fields was getting fired?
I' m on it.
You just concentrate on being Gracie Lou, all right.
And by the way, you' re doing a great job.
I thought the evening gown looked....
- I totally bought it.
- I know, you think I' m gorgeous.
I don' t think you' re gorgeous.
You think I' m gorgeous.
You want to kiss me.
You want to hug me --
McDonald' s more feminine.
I' d rather kiss him. - - love me.
You want to hug me.
You want to smooch me.
Enjoy the rest of your night.
Gracie, you look so tired.
Oh, she had a busy night.
I saw that gentleman stop by the room.
- No men in the room.
- It' s different on the mainland.
Let' s hear her side of the story.
You sleeping with a judge?
Oh, that guy?
No, no, I was dating him for a little while because...... he said he had an incurable disease.
I didn' t realize it was stupidity.
Oh, I know what that' s like.
He is such a pathetic loser.
I' m sorry he' s obsessed with me, but at some point it' s like, "Hello!"
"Move on!
His ego is this big.
But his equipment is like this big!
Good cover!
We worked that out together.
Back to work.
Get ready for the Alamo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And welcome to the Miss United States Preliminary...... here at the beautiful and historical Alamo!
Prepare for what promises to be...... a day of astounding musical, theatrical and dancing talent.
And after I' m finished, you can see the ladies.
Oh, yes!
And now, put it together...... for Miss Mary Jo Wright from Texas!
What' s her talent, bartending?
I made it very clear you weren' t responsible for making her credible.
I wish I could explain...... but there are no words.
Eagle- Eye.
You might want to check out cowboy at 1: 00.
My 1: 00 or your 1: 00?
The one under the white Stetson.
There' s Stetsons everywhere.
He' s moving, he' s moving.
- Toward the stage.
- Hold on, we' re checking it out.
Guys, he has a gun.
Who' s got the 20 on the shooter?
I' m taking him out.
Wait for a visual!
Gun!
Gun!
Everybody down!
Better up to them, don' t you think?
She' s here with me right now.
What were you thinking when you jumped off the stage?
All the contestants are actively involved in ending tobacco dependence.
I think the gentleman will think twice before he lights up again.
I' m sure we all will.
- Look, he had a gun.
- Of course.
This is Texas, everyone has a gun.
My florist has a gun.
I don' t have a gun.
My ancestors were Quakers.
Stan, please!
We assume any man with a weapon is a suspect.
We got the DNA results.
The envelope from the Citizen was licked by a woman.
There' s never been DNA before.
He slipped up, or I should say "she."
This is preposterous.
You people are completely clueless.
If I ran my pageant like this, we' d be holding it in someone' s basement!
Every operation is bound to have its screwups.
As far as I can see, she' s still with us.
Oh, God!
Could I have a moment alone with Miss Hart, please?
Sure.
Just for a tiny minute.
Shop talk.
Hair, gel, mousse.
Look, I know I made a mistake.
I' m sorry.
I' ve been fighting all my life against your type.
The ones who think we' re a bunch of worthless airheads.
You know who I mean.
Feminists...... intellectuals...... ugly women.
I refuse to give in to their cynicism.
That' s why I have dedicated my entire life to this scholarship.
Not this year.
You get in my way, I will kill you.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Yes.
Frank!
The interview is the single most important part of the pageant.
It accounts for 30% of your total score.
What' s the other 70%, cleavage?
Is this your idea of doing final preps on the convention center?
Liberace' s got her in a nice evening gown.
He saw Hart' s anti - smoking commercial.
He' s on his way.
Good, perfect.
I' d hate for him to fire me over the phone.
I can' t believe this!
It' il be ugly.
No shit.
I gotta do something.
I' m gonna go do laps.
We' il go over tomorrow' s assignments.
You got it.
Hands folded...... ankles crossed.
Neck up!
And remember, smile.
Smilers wear a crown, losers wear a frown.
I would so love to hurt you right now.
As long as you smile.
Now....
Why is New Jersey called...... the Garden State?
You can' t fit "Oil and petrochemical refinery state" on a license plate?
I don' t appreciate your immaturity...... when I' m working as hard as I am.
What' s the big deal?
It' s fixed, I' m in the Top Five.
Congratulations to me.
Is that enough?
Have you no pride in yourself, in your presentation?
I' m an FBI agent, right?
I' m not a performing monkey in heels.
You' re also a person, and an incomplete one at that!
In place of friends and relationships, you have sarcasm and a gun.
When every word that comes out of your mouth is dripping with disdain?
That is because I am a miserable, grumpy elitist, and that works for me.
I don' t have relationships because I don' t want them.
And I don' t have friends because I work 24- 7.
And you have no idea why I am the way that I am.
As we' re practicing interviews, why are you the way you are?
None of your damn business.
The judges probably have never heard that before.
We have more to do here.
No, we are finished.
Finished?
- Give me a 20 on Matthews.
- Be advised he' s at the pool.
"How do you feel about gun control?"
Favorable.
Thought I' d let you know I was quitting.
Take care.
Hold on.
Wait a minute.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you got the wrong girl.
All right?
I do not need this now.
That' s what I' m saying!
I' m totally screwing up in there!
I don' t feel like a real agent anymore.
I mean, Vic says this thing that' s so....
I don' t care.
Because I am the job...... and I' m okay with that.
You' re the job?
Yeah, I' m the job.
We' re all the job.
I date.
I know everyone thinks I haven' t had a date in 10 years.
Is that what you think?
Damn right I do.
I don' t even care.
All I want to do...... is my job.
For the last three days I feel like I' m completely lost.
I' ve been waiting five years to run my own op.
- Would I blow it on the wrong girl?
- You picked me...... because I looked good and wasn' t on maternity leave.
No, that' s why they let me pick you.
- Lost a bet.
- You' re smart...... and funny and you' re easy to talk to when you' re unarmed.
Give yourself a break and cut Vic some slack.
Because if they see what I see, then...... they' il love you.
So, what do you say?
I won' t let you down.
Good, that' s what I want to hear.
In all honesty, I might let you down.
But I' il try my best not to.
Do not mess with the dress.
Oh, Vic is gonna kill you.
You in big trouble.
You fell.
- You look good wet.
- Shut up!
Whoa, guys, Hart' s in the dressing room.
Come on.
- You see the legs on that girl?
- Who' s your daddy?
Those better be candy dishes!
Open.
This guy' s like an inch from death!
But what a way to go!
Nothing to see.
- What do you mean?
She' s a federal agent.
Guess it' s time to apply at my local Hooters.
Hemorrhoid ointment?
You think the judges will look that closely?
It' s for the baggies under your eyes.
Really?
Good, hair spray.
Finally something I recognize.
What are you doing?
It stops the suit from riding up.
Just up!
That' s enough!
Why do you make things hard?
I can see this is an incredibly embarrassing situation for you.
Why does Georgia get to wear a one- piece and I have to wear this?!
If you can do this, then you can convince anyone that you belong here.
Places, everybody!
Let' s go!
The Swimsuit Preliminary accounts for 15% of the total score...... and tests the grace, athleticism and poise...... of each lovely woman.
The last time I was naked in public, I came out of a uterus.
I don' t have breasts, my thighs -- I should wear a muumuu.
I have avoided this experience all my life.
You must achieve a Zen- like state.
Listen to your breathing, feel your heart...... think of the Dalai Lama.
Texas!
Rhode Island!
New Jersey!
Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama....
New York!
California!
I would have to say, world peace.
Definitely, world peace.
That' s easy.
World peace.
World peace.
What is the one most important thing our society needs?
That would be harsher punishment for parole violators, Stan.
And, world peace.
Thank you, Gracie Lou.
And thank you, Stan.
Cheryl Frasier from Rhode Island.
Are you drunk?
Glad you enjoyed it.
Now excuse me, I have to go unscrew my smile.
We got a lead.
- Photos.
Cheryl Frasier, with members of a radical animal rights group...
-... involved in bombings.
- It' s always the quiet ones.
loner, introverted.
That Cheryl?
Describe your perfect date.
That' s a tough one.
I' d have to say April 25th...... because it' s not too hot, not too cold.
All you need is a light jacket.
Now, there is a hardened criminal.
Maybe she' s an accomplice.
Maybe she' s his inside connection.
That' s what you gotta find out.
How?
Buddy up to her, you know, girl talk.
- Girl talk?
- Yeah, girl talk.
Sorry, I' m totally drawing a blank.
Leg waxing, fake orgasms, the inability of men to commit.
Why don' t you talk to her?
Imagine she' s me and you want to know, but I don' t want to talk about it.
What would you do?
You want me to beat her?
Why don' t you talk to her?
I will go.
Put that back in your ear.
I can' t talk girl talk with a guy in my head.
I can' t even do it with me in my head.
Girl talk.
Oh, my God!
How can you ask that?
You heard my interview.
I was like a female Rain Man.
Oh, no, it definitely wasn' t Rain Man.
Definitely not Rain Man.
Come and have a midnight snack with me and some...... girl talk.
Are you crazy?
We can' t have pizza and beer!
Do you know how many calories you' re talking about?
It' s light beer and she' s gonna throw it up anyway.
Come on.
Come with.
No takers?
No?
You guys go back on your bicycles...... and I' il sit here with my very large, cheesy pizza.
Oh, look at all that cheese.
Cheryl, don' t.
At least scrape off the toppings.
First step, pizza.
Second step, flaming batons....
I guess we' il be needing more pizza.
I want another drink!
We' re gonna get a drink.
Another round, ladies?
- I can' t do another one!
- Yes, you can!
This is so weird!
This is my third one of these and I don' t feel a thing!
Really?
Kinda like when I answered my interview question.
Don' t worry about that, we all sucked.
You know, I had such a good answer to that question too.
My idea of a perfect date would be a man...... who takes me to a romantic dinner.
Then we walk along the beach barefoot, discussing books...... and music and movies!
No wonder you' re still a virgin.
Time to paint.
Come on.
No, my contacts.
- We' il stay here.
- I want more pizza.
We' re gonna have some more pizza and beer.
Have fun!
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah, it' s fun.
It' s so fun it should be illegal.
Speaking of illegal, have you ever, like...... committed a crime?
Yes!
Yes, I did.
Go on.
One time I stole red underwear from the department store.
My mother wouldn' t buy them!
She said they were Satan' s panties.
- So is that it?
- Yeah.
Oh, there was this one thing in college...... with my Lit professor.
He said he wanted to discuss a paper I wrote.
He wanted to discuss a paper, right?
Hey, can I get another one of these tubie things?
Yeah, can we get another tubie?
Anyway, he attacked me.
Che -- Cheryl, did you report him?
Oh no, I never told anyone before this.
No, no, it doesn' t!
Cheryl, it doesn' t.
You know, there' s like so many maneuvers that I could show you.
Really?
Yeah!
Come on, you know, get up.
I want you to firmly plant your feet.
I' m gonna move the chair.
Now if someone comes at you --
She' s completely trashed.
We should get her back before Miss Morningside finds out.
Kathy' s got a boot up her ass about something.
Come again?
Her pageant years she was a runner- up.
But then the winner mysteriously got food poisoning.
Bizarro!
No, Stan told me she got a letter a few weeks back from the network...... and they' re firing her too!
She threw a chair out the window!
We gotta go.
Come on.
I got 20 people here waiting for confirmation.
Don' t tell me I don' t understand.
I hate when I don' t see a wet paint sign.
Listen.
- Can' t hear you, took out my earpiece.
- I have a lead and it' s not Cheryl.
Forget it.
They bagged the Citizen.
What?
It' s confirmed.
He was holing up in a shack in Nevada.
Place had enough C4 to make a new Grand Canyon.
Let' s pack up and get out of here.
Sir, I need to talk to you.
One second of your time.
Hear me out a second.
I feel the situation bears further scrutiny and our continued presence.
Do you have paint in your ears?
We caught the guy!
I respect what you' re saying.
I' d say the same to me...... but what if we were wrong?
What if the Citizen didn' t send it?
The letter didn' t follow the normal pattern.
The linguistic scheme was uncharacteristic...... and the DNA said it was a woman!
Maybe he got his girlfriend to lick the envelope.
I think we have reason to monitor Morningside.
Why don' t you jump on her dressed like a Bavarian fruitcake?
You' re the reason I had to drag myself down here...... and I don' t want to hear anymore!
You' re absolutely right, sir.
Not another damn word.
Thank you.
But she' s getting fired this year, which she didn' t tell us.
You' re already in enough trouble with the review board.
Yeah, but when she was in the pageant, the only reason she won was...... because the winner got food poisoning.
How bizarro is that?
"Bizarro"?
She threatened me.
According to Mary Jo, she has a history of violence.
Who is Mary Jo?
Are you getting your information from a pajama party?
Would you shut up?
You' re shutting up enough for both of us.
Is there any reason to suspect Morningside?
No, sir.
There.
I request permission to stay with a small contingent.
Denied.
Then I request permission to stay alone.
You know what, I don' t care what you do.
You want to stay, stay!
But as a private citizen.
Turn in your badge and your gun.
Everybody, I suggest we start packing.
What?
Don' t look at me like I betrayed you.
Betrayal implies action.
You stood there.
You got nothing to go on.
I know everyone thinks I' m a screwup.
But I feel like I' m in the right place at the right time.
I have to protect those girls.
It is my job.
Part of it is following orders.
The other part is using your brain.
Throw out the rule book --
I like the book.
I like knowing what I can and cannot do.
You' re not the only one who lives for the job.
I want to keep mine for the next 20 or 30 years.
Jesus, Hart.
Give it a rest.
Sure, give it a rest.
What are you doing?
Don' t do it.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I can' t believe it!
Hi, Mom.
Don' t do that!
That slow, creepy thing in the shadows.
Your father used to do that.
Mom.
This isn' t gonna work.
Why, of course it' s going to work.
The feds caught the Citizen.
We have no one to pin it on!
Okay, that was bad luck.
But what about all these other letters from terrorist groups threatening us?
"Women' s Liberation Front."
"Islamic Jihad." They' re not so nuts about the Swimsuit Competition.
Any one of these could have planted a bomb.
When did we get those?
I just finished writing them.
Just like the Citizen letter.
You' re a genius.
I' m just pissed off.
Nobody fires me and gets away with it.
They want a newer, hotter show...... they' re gonna get it.
Mom, you' re a little scary.
And you' re a little bit sloppy.
Tuck your shirt.
I don' t want to tell you again.
Let' s go home, honey.
Mom?
- Need a hand, boss?
- I got it.
Okay, Vic.
Beautify me.
Hair, makeup, shellac, whatever it is you do.
That shiny stuff --
Where are you going?
Your Agent McDonald insists that I depart, or I won' t be compensated.
I am completely on my own.
The FBI is gone, it' s not fixed.
I need you!
Not anymore.
The cocoon is open.
I' ve taken a woman without a smidgen of estrogen...... and made her a lady.
- Come on.
- I' ve never been prouder of myself.
Or...... of any girl I have ever coached.
You are truly unique.
If I ever had a daughter, I imagine that she would be...... something like you.
Which is why I never reproduced.
I have a really strong feeling something will happen to these girls.
Please.
I can' t.
But I can leave you this.
I was saving it for tonight.
It' s your size, I believe.
Good luck to you, Gracie Lou.
It' s been a privilege.
No insults today?
Has anyone seen Gracie?
I can' t believe she missed dress rehearsal.
Maybe she couldn' t take the pressure.
She ate four slices last night.
We all saw her glasses performance.
I overslept my beauty sleep.
- Do you need help?
- No, I' m fine.
I wonder which one of these...... is lipstick.
Ladies!
Good luck, ladies!
Let' s go!
Looking good, ladies.
Will you go back to the mothership?
As long as you go with me, Tex- Ass.
Let' s go, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas....
I can' t open the goddamn bottle.
Have a good show.
You guys excited?
Where are you going?
I forgot my breasts.
Going live.
In five, four, three....
It' s the 75th Annual Miss United States Pageant...... live from San Antonio, Texas!
That' s the one I use at home.
And your host for the evening, Stan Fields!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
And welcome to a night of beauty, talent and poise.
I' m not just talking about my cohost...... Kathy Morningside!
- Hello, Kathy.
- Stan, you charmer.
That was incredibly stupid of me.
How can I make it up?
By helping me to announce the Top 10...... chosen based on their performance during the preliminaries this past week.
Here' s the envelope.
Thank you, Scott.
Ladies, hold your breath.
Hawaii!
And we' re following.
Come in for that reaction.
- Go to two.
- Going two.
California!
New York!
Alaska!
Texas!
New Jersey!
Oh, shit!
That was graceful.
That must have hurt.
But she' s up and at it.
And last but not least, Rhode Island.
And there they are!
This year' s Top 10 finalists.
The Top 10 have been chosen.
We' il be right back with tonight' s Swimsuit Competition.
I checked out Kathy Morningside.
- Anything?
Model citizen.
Beauty contestant, pageant director, loving mom.
- She' s married?
One son.
- You know her son?
It' s Frank.
- Her assistant?
- Asshole Frank?
One and the same.
She never mentioned anything.
Anything come up on the CCH?
Nothing on Frank Tobin.
There wouldn' t be.
His name is Morningside.
He changed it to cover his many indiscretions.
How do you know that?
I' ve been around this pageant for many years.
I could shock you with the intimate details I' m privy to.
Good job!
Good job
I got you something.
I couldn' t --
You ate pizza, you stole panties, you' re wild.
We worked on this, remember?
You' re gonna be great.
- Can I see your ticket?
- Federal officer.
I' m with him.
Gentlemen, you can' t go in --
Victor!
He' s with me.
I' m not "with him" with him.
Come on, muffin.
Thank you!
She certainly lit my fire.
Now you can wear Satan' s panties!
- Hey, Hart.
- What are you doing here?
I think you might have been right.
Frank is Kathy Morningside' s son.
Disgusting, perverted Frank?
He cleared under another name.
I ran a new CCH.
DUl, assault, even a weapons charge.
McDonald didn' t want to hear about it.
It' s just us.
Good show, Mr. Tobin.
You' re up next, New Jersey.
I gotta get my glasses.
You' re drinking my talent!
You got to make it into the Top Five!
- Can you whistle?
- No!
- Make hand puppets?
- No!
I had a girl who rearranged furniture.
That and a right hook.
And now, the musical stylings of Gracie Lou Freebush.
The program says I' m supposed to play the water glasses for you...... but the girls got dehydrated.
No water glasses?
You want me to go to a commercial?
Go with it.
I believe that no woman should be without a basic knowledge of self- defense.
So in order to show you this, I' m gonna need a little help.
More changes?
Follow her.
Stay on her. - - how to inflict damage with the least amount of force.
In some cases, your attacker might come at you in a frontal assault.
Use the heel of your hand and thrust.
This will cause the nose to break and your assailant' s eyes to tear...... giving you a chance to get away.
Let' s say your assailant comes at you from behind.
Attack me!
Little Eric looks a little scared.
Maybe he needs a little applause.
She' s kicking his ass!
You were the best queen ever.
Thank you, that is so sweet.
Ladies, give Lori some room to breathe.
Go on, now.
You need some powder.
You don' t have to hold the crown all night.
My God, that is disgraceful.
Frank!
Take this to the prop master.
See if you can' t get it to shine.
If all else fails, go for the four sensitive areas of the body.
But just remember to "sing."
S- I- N- G.
Solar plexus, Instep...... Nose, Groin!
Sing.
Cue Stan.
Welcome to the Garden State!
When we return, we' il find out who those lucky Final Five are.
Let' s go find Frank.
Take left.
I' il take this side.
No.
Evening gown, now.
Ladies!
In one moment, five of you...... will be one step closer to the crown.
And one of those five...... is...... California!
Leslie Williams is a music major.
She believes in the healing power of music.
Loves opera, reggae...... and, like any true California girl, the Beach Boys.
Rhode Island!
Cheryl Frasier is a science major.
Her field is...... nuclear fission with a minor in elementary particles.
Nebraska!
For Kelly Beth Kelly, all the world is a stage.
A theater major...... she helps run a drama program for underprivileged children.
New Jersey!
Gracie Lou Freebush hopes to become a pediatrician.
Gracie, it' s you.
Go!
Her hobbies include figure skating, water ballet...... and taking long, luxurious bubble baths.
You go, Gracie Lou.
And our fifth finalist:
Texas!
Mary Jo Wright is a psychology major.
In her spare time, she works in a homeless shelter...... and eats Mexican food.
Thank you, ladies.
You were magnificent.
I want all the lesbians to know...... if I can make it to the Top 10, so can you!
Yo!
Get her off of there!
Go to Stan!
Tina, I love you, baby!
I love you, Karen!
And we' il be right back with our final five lesbians.
Bumper.
Can we say "lesbians"?
You got a problem with that?
In a way, America is like a big ship.
When we work together and respect each other...... that' s when the ship gets safely home.
Terrific answer.
Damn it.
New Jersey.
As you may know, there are many who consider...... the Miss United States pageant to be outdated and antifeminist.
What would you say to them?
Oh, my God.
I would have to say, I used to be one of them.
And then I came here...... and I realized that...... these women are smart, terrific people...... who are just trying to make a difference in the world.
We' ve become really good friends.
I know we all secretly hope the other one will trip and fall on her face --
Wait a minute!
I' ve already done that!
For me, this experience has been one of the most rewarding...... and liberating experiences of my life.
My God.
I did it.
And if anyone...... anyone...... tries to hurt one of my new friends...... I would take them out.
I would make them suffer so much, they' d wish they were never born.
And if they ran, I would hunt them down.
Thank you, Kathy.
A brief, shining moment, and then that mouth.
Helps if you pull it out.
Good luck, ladies.
I wanted to rub the crown for luck.
Frank took it to get it polished.
I' il have it by the time they announce the winner.
My God!
It' s the crown!
Yes, it is.
You can taste it now --
No, no, no!
Not the -- This in the --
Yes.
Wear the crown.
Be the crown.
You are the crown.
And now, the moment of truth and beauty.
The envelope, please.
What?
A lot of tension.
The fourth runner- up is...... California!
The third runner- up is...... Nebraska!
- Am I in danger here?
- Wait here.
The second runner- up is Texas!
Drop it!
I mean it!
Drop it!
This is it.
The moment.
One of these two ladies will wear the crown.
Listen to me!
I' m gonna reach for my badge slow.
You do, and you' re dead.
New Jersey!
Which means...... our new Miss United States is:
Don' t take the crown.
Rhode Island' s Cheryl Frasier!
Don' t take the crown.
Trust me.
She' s beauty and she' s grace
She' s queen of 50 states She' s elegance and taste
She' s Miss United States
Hold your crown up high
Raise it to the sky
Jersey' s gone berserk!
Get her off the stage!
Hold your crown up high
Raise it to the sky
She stands for all that' s good
She loves her neighborhood
She' s friends with everyone she meets
She' s beauty and she' s grace
She' s queen of 50 states
She' s elegance and taste
She' s Miss United States
Gracie!
She' s Miss United States.
Okay.
Good show, everybody.
I was right in the middle of my song!
You got nothing on me.
This is ridiculous.
Where you' re going, they' d love to meet a former beauty queen.
When he says meet, he means M- E- A- T.
Miss Hart, you don' t understand.
All I' m guilty of is trying to make the world a more beautiful place.
Look at yourself.
When I met you, Dennis Rodman looked better in a dress.
But now you' re a lady!
I did that.
No, Vic did that, and a team of highly specialized federal manicurists...... and people who make you beautiful.
You know, you' re under arrest, get in the car.
You think you saved something.
All you did was to destroy the dream of young women all over the country.
Their dream is to get blown up?
You got a good shot at that insanity plea.
I earned it!
Fired!
It is a scholarship program.
Yeah, yeah.
"Yes."
Get it?
That was good work.
Right back at you.
So, how does it feel?
Throwing the rule book out of the window?
Pretty good, actually.
I was thinking...... when we get back...... after we write up our reports and you get all ugly again...... maybe we could have dinner?
You asking me out on a date?
Just a casual dinner.
If we happen to have sex afterwards, so be it.
You think I' m gorgeous.
You want to date me...... love me and marry me.
A part of you is gonna miss this.
The heels.
They do something for my posture.
I' m suddenly very aware and proud of my breasts.
- Funny, me too.
- Agent Matthews!
Gracie!
Thank God you' re still here.
There' s been an emergency.
Somebody found some sort of incendiary device.
Come on, quickly!
Excuse me.
FBl.
She saved the pageant, she saved our lives, and here she is!
That' s not gonna work for me.
I can' t go up there!
It was his idea, Gracie Lou.
I' d never get you here unless you could shoot someone.
You' il get yours, Henry Higgins.
Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, agent Gracie Hart of the FBl!
Not so fast!
Because even though you' re a federal officer...... to us, you will always be Gracie Lou Freebush.
The nicest, sweetest, coolest girl at the pageant...... and this year' s Miss Congeniality!
I don' t know what to say.
Except for...... I can' t wear this at work.
I never thought anything like this would happen to me.
I kind of hoped it wouldn' t.
But now that it has...... I just want to say that...... I' m very...
... very honored.
And...... moved.
And...... truly touched.
And...
... I really do want world peace.
Royal Tenenbaum bought the house on Archer Avenue in the winter of his 35th year.
Over the next decade he and his wife had three children and then they separated.
Are you getting divorced?
At the moment, no... but... it doesn' t look good.
Do you still love us?
Of course I do.
Do you still love Mom?
Yes, very much, but your mother' s asked me to leave and I must respect her position on the matter.
Is it our fault?
No.
No.
Obviously, we made certain sacrifices as a result of having children, but, uh... no, Lord, no.
Then why' d she ask you to leave?
I don' t really know anymore.
Maybe, uh, I wasn' t as true to her as I could' ve been.
Well, she said...
Let' s just drop it shall we, uh, Chassie?
They were never legally divorced.
Thank you, Pagoda.
Etheline Tenenbaum keptthe house and raised the children and their education was her highest priority.
Yes, I' il hold, please.
Thank you.
I need $187.
Write yourself a check.
Bene.
Si.
Grazie mille.
She wrote a book on the subject.
- Chas, Chas!
- Richie!
Uh, the gentleman in the blue cardigan, please.
Thank you.
I have a two- part question.
Go ahead.
Chas Tenenbaum had, since elementary school taken most of his meals in his room standing up at his desk with a cup of coffee to save time.
In the sixth grade, he went into business breeding Dalmatian mice which he sold to a pet shop in Little Tokyo.
He started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance.
He negotiated the purchase of his father' s summer house on Eagle' s Island.
Hold it, Chassie.
Hold it right there.
What are you doing?
You' re on my team.
There are no teams.
The BB was still lodged between two knuckles in Chas' s left hand.
Margot Tenenbaum was adopted at age two.
Her father had always noted this when introducing her.
This is my adopted daughter Margot Tenenbaum.
She was a playwright, and won a Braverman Grant of $50, 000 in the ninth grade.
She and her brother Richie ran away from home one winter and camped out in the African wing of the public archives.
Hi, Eli.
You said I could run away, too.
No, I didn' t, and don' t tell anyone you saw us.
They shared a sleeping bag and survived on crackers and root beer.
Fouryears later
Margot disappeared alone for two weeks and came back with half a finger missing.
Richie Tenenbaum had been a champion tennis player since the third grade.
He turned pro at 17 and won the U. S. Nationals three years in a row.
He kept a studio in the corner of the ballroom but had failed to develop as a painter.
Up... up... right... perfect.
Pagoda?
On weekends
Royal took him on outings around the city.
These invitations were never extended to anyone else.
Richie' s best friend, Eli Cash, lived with his aunt in the building across the street.
He was a regular fixture at family gatherings holidays, mornings before school, and most afternoons.
The three Tenenbaum children performed Margot' s first play on the night of her 1 1th birthday.
They had agreed to invite their father to the party.
What' d you think, Dad?
Mmm... didn' t seem believable to me.
Why are you wearing pajamas?
Do you live here?
He has permission to sleep over.
Well, did you at least think the characters were well- developed?
What characters?
This is a bunch of little kids, uh dressed up in animal costumes.
Good night, everyone.
Well, sweetie... don' t be mad at me.
That' s just one man' s opinion.
He had not been invited to any of theirparties since.
In fact, virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums had been erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster.
Go, Mordecai.
I' ve been instructed to refuse any further charges on your room account and to direct you, in writing to please vacate the premises by the end of the month.
What about Sing- Sang?
I owe her $100.
Royal had lived in the Lindbergh Palace Hotel for 22 years.
Can you pay her in cash?
He was a prominent litigator until the mid '80s when he was disbarred and briefly imprisoned.
No one in his family had spoken to him in three years.
Read it back to me so far, Pietro.
New paragraph.
Richie had retired from professional tennis at 26.
His last match had been widely discussed in the media.
"Your friend Richie."
End of letter.
For the pastyear, he had been traveling alone on an ocean liner called the Cote d' lvoire and had seen both poles, five oceans the Amazon and the Nile.
Eli was an assistant professor of English literature at Brooks College.
The recent publication of his second novel... (horses galloping, gunfire, shouting)... had earned him a sudden, unexpected literary celebrity.
Well, everyone knows Custer died at Little Bighorn.
What this book presupposes is... maybe he didn' t.
Let me ask you something.
Why would a review make the point of saying someone' s nota genius?
You think I' m especially nota genius?
I know w...
You didn' t even have to think about it, did you?
Well, I just don' t use thatword lightly.
I have to go, Eli.
Margot?
May I come in, please?
How are you, my darling?
Margo was married to the writer and neurologist
Raleigh St. Clair.
I' m fine, thank you.
You need to eat something.
May I make you dinner?
No, thank you.
She was known for her extreme secrecy.
For example, none of the Tenenbaums knew she was a smoker, which she had been since the age of 12.
Nor were they aware of her first marriage and divorce to a recording artist in Jamaica.
She kept a private studio in Mockingbird Heights under the name "Helen Scott."
She had not completed a play in seven years.
17 October, third examination of Dudley Heinsbergen.
All right, Dudley make yours like mine.
Raleigh' s next book was on the subject of a condition he called "Heinsbergen Syndrome."
Where' s that red one going to go?
Done.
Good.
Very good.
My goodness.
How interesting.
How bizarre.
Dudley suffers from a rare disorder combining symptoms of amnesia, dyslexia and color blindness.
He has a highly acute sense of hearing.
There is also evidence of...
I' m not color blind, am l?
I' m afraid you are.
Ari, fire alarm!
Let' s go!
Out you go!
Let' s go!
Uzi, emergency!
Let' s go!
Uzi... what did I just say?!
Look alive!
Fire!
Chas' s wife Rachael was killed in a plane crash the previous summer.
What about Buckley?
It' s too late.
You forgot him.
Buckley!
Buckley!
No elevator!
There' s a fire.
Go, go!
Chas and theirtwo sons, Ari and Uzi were also on the flight and survived as did their dog who was discovered in his cage several thousand yards from the crash site.
Four minutes, 48 seconds.
We' re all dead, burnt to a crisp.
Over the last six months he had become increasingly concerned with their safety.
We left Buckley.
It doesn' t matter.
Etheline became an archaeologist and had overseen excavations for the Department of Housing and the Transit Authority.
Apropos of my question regarding l- 40 slash l- 9 adjustments... um... (clears throat)
She taught a bridge class twice a week with herfriend and business manager, Henry Sherman.
It would probably be advantageous for your marital status to be legally established as single in light of the circumstances.
What do you mean?
I mean for tax purposes.
But I thought...
- Etheline...
- Yes?
Will you marry me?
I...
I love you, uh...
Did you already know that?
No, I didn' t.
Since herseparation from her husband she had had many suitors...
... but had not considered a single one until this moment.
This isn' t really a tax issue, is it?
That' s true, uh...
I don' t know why I put it that way.
Let me think about it, Henry.
Hello.
Please tell Mr. Royal this is the Pagoda.
Lobby.
Thank you, Dusty.
You' re welcome.
Good morning, Jerry.
Oh, there' s a call for you, Mr. Tenenbaum.
Who is it, Frederick?
A Mr. Pagoda.
What do you got?
The black man asked her to be his wife.
No shit?
What did Ethel say?
She think about it.
I don' t like the sound of this one damn bit, Pagoda.
I mean...
Lord knows
I' ve had my share of infidelities but she' s still my wife.
And no damn two- bit, chartered accountant is going to change that.
Hi.
Hey, Pagoda, give us a hand, huh?
Chas?
What' s going on?
We got locked out of our apartment.
Did you call a locksmith?
Well, I don' t understand.
Did you pack your bags before you got locked out or how did you...?
It' s not safe over there.
Excuse me for a moment.
What are you talking about?
The apartment.
I have to get some new sprinklers and a backup security system installed.
But there are no sprinklers here, either.
Well, we might have to do something about that, too.
Okay.
lsn' t this fun, huh?
lsn' t this great?
Feels like we' re camping.
When are we going home?
Hey, look at this.
Pretty cool, huh? / Who am I supposed to be? /
Okay.
Well, I will see you boys in the morning.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night. / Look at me /
You know what?
I think I' m going to sleep in here with you.
That way... (grunts)... we can all be together.
What kind of side effects can be expected?
Well, there are a number of possibilities.
Severe nausea and dizziness are standard.
A certain percentage of patients may also experience seizure.
You mean, like flopping around on the floor and everything?
In some cases.
You have a visitor, my darling.
Who is it?
It' s me, sweetie.
locked in here, watching television and soaking in the tub.
I doubt that.
I don' t think that' s very healthy, do you?
Nor do I think it' s very intelligent to keep an electrical gadget on the edge of the bathtub.
I tie it to the radiator.
Well, it can' t be very good for your eyes, anyway.
Chas came home.
What do you mean?
He and Ari and Uzi are going to stay with me for a little while.
Why are they allowed to do that?
I don' t know exactly but I think he' s been very depressed.
So am l.
So are you, what?
But why is this necessary?
'Cause I' m in a rut, and I need a change.
Hang on.
Taxi!
That cab has a dent in it.
You don' t love me anymore, do you?
I do, kind of.
I can' t explain it right now.
Another dent here, and another dent here.
I' il call you, okay?
Hello.
Hello?
Hello, beautiful.
Got a minute?
What are you doing here?
Uh, I need a favor.
I want to spend some time with you and the children.
Are you crazy?
Well, wait a minute, damn it!
Stop following me.
Well, I want my family back.
Well, you can' t have it.
I' m sorry for you, but it' s too late.
Well, listen...
Baby, I' m dying.
Yeah, I' m- I' m sick as a dog.
I' il be dead in six weeks.
I' m dying.
What are you talking about?
What' s happening?
Oh, I' m sorry.
I didn' t know.
Well, what' d they say?
What is the prognosis?
Take it easy, Ethel.
Now, hold- hold on, baby, hold on.
Where is the doctor?
W- Wait a second now.
Okay, uh, listen, I' m not dying... but I need some time.
A month or so, okay?
I want us...
I want us to- to...
What' s wrong with you?!
Ethel.
Are you crazy?!
Ethel, baby...
I am dying.
Are you or aren' t you?
What?
Dying?
Yeah.
Have you told your children?
More or less.
And are they all right?
It' s hard to say.
Who' s your father?
His name is Royal Tenenbaum.
You told us he was already dead.
Yeah, well, now he' s really dying.
- Ready.
- Print it.
I am very sorry, Margo.
That' s okay.
We' re not actually related, anyway.
True.
I' d like to send a response, please.
Yes, sir, go ahead.
Dear Mom:
I received your message.
I' m coming home as soon as possible.
Who do I see about that?
The ship' s porter arranged for Richie to disembark at Halifax and transfer to a third- class state room on board the Queen Helena destined for the Eastern seaboard.
His trunks would not arrive for another 1 1 days.
Do you mind if we get a picture with you?
Not at all.
He had made a request for his usual escort the one from his days on the circuit to meet him at the pier by way of the Green Line bus.
Hi.
As always, she was late.
Stand up straight.
Let me get a look at you.
What' s so funny?
Well it' s nice to see you, too.
living together under the same roof for the first time in 17 years.
Where' s your dad?
The next morning, Richie woke at dawn.
He had decided birds should not be kept in cages fed Mordecai three sardines, and set him free.
I' ve missed the hell out of you, my darlings.
Well, you know that, though, don' t you?
I hear you' re dying.
So they tell me.
I' m sorry.
Well, I' ve had a good run.
You don' t look so sick, Dad.
Thank you.
What have you got?
I' ve got a pretty bad case of cancer.
How long you going to last?
Not long.
A month, a year?
About six weeks.
Let me get to the point.
The three of you and your mother are all I' ve got and I love you more than anything.
- Ho- ho.
Now, I' ve got six weeks to set things right with you and I aim to do it.
Will you give me a chance?
No.
You speak for everyone?
I speak for myself.
Well, you' ve made your views known.
Let somebody else do some of the talking now.
What do you propose to do?
I can' t say, really.
Um, make up for lost time, I suppose.
First thing I want to do is take you out to see your grandmother, at some point.
I haven' t been out there since I was six.
I haven' t been out there at all.
I was never invited.
Well, she wasn' t your real grandmother and I never knew how much interest you had, uh, sweetie.
Anyway, you' re invited now.
Thanks.
You know, Rachael' s buried out there, too.
Who?
My wife.
Oh, that' s right, isn' t it?
Well, we' il have to swing by her grave, too.
Uh, I' il be right back.
Chas.
Chas.
Can I see my grandsons?
Why?
Because I finally want to meet them.
Don' t give me that guff.
I think we' il pass.
Pagoda... where' s my Havelina?
I' il say good- night to you now, children.
Dad.
Thank you, my sweet boy.
I' il contact you in the next 12 hours with further instructions.
Look at that old grizzly bear.
Hello, Ethel.
Good evening, sir.
Hold the cab, will you, driver?
Royal, this is Henry Sherman.
Hey, lay it on me, man.
How do you do?
Not too well.
I' m dying.
How' s Richie?
I don' t know.
I can' t tell.
Yeah, me neither.
He wrote me a letter.
He says he' s in love with you.
What are you talking about?
That' s what he said.
I don' t know how we' re supposed to take it.
Hang on.
Hello.
Sugar, it' s Eli.
What are we doing, Eli?
Oh, I just got to pick something up.
Don' t repeat that, by the way.
About Richie.
It was told to me in confidence, and, you know... (lock buzzes)
Now just remove the loose soil and note the decomposition levels.
I' m sorry to interrupt your work.
Don' t be silly.
Come on.
I just want to apologize for the other day when I proposed to you.
Why?
I thought it was very sweet.
I know I' m not as accomplished as some of the men you' ve been involved with.
Uh, Franklin Benedict, General Cartwright, and your ex- husband.
But, but, I feel...
I can offer just as much as them.
I know I went about it backwards, but...
Henry, I have no interest in Franklin Benedict or Doug Cartwright -- I never did -- and as far as Royal' s concerned, he' s the most...
Henry?
Henry, are you all right?
Yeah, I' m fine.
I' m fine.
Anyway, let me know when you make up your mind.
Henry, wait a second.
I' m sorry, I' m very nervous.
Th- That' s okay.
Oh, thank you.
Why are you so nervous?
I haven' t slept with a man in 18 years. / Dah- dah- dum /
That' s a hell of an old hound dog you got there.
What' s he go by?
Buckley.
Buckley, sit.
You know who I am?
I' m Royal.
Have you heard of me?
I' m very sorry for your loss.
Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.
Thank you.
Which one are you?
Ari.
Uzi, I' m your granddad.
Hello.
I' m sorry we haven' t gotten to know each other.
I don' t get invited around very much.
What do you think of that, by the way?
Oh, you... you don' t have to say anything.
It' s kind of a "fuck you" to the old man, I guess.
How' s your daddy?
Fine.
You think so, huh?
How often has he got you working out?
16 times a week.
Do me a favor.
Tell him you want to meet me.
But we just met.
No, we didn' t.
Look, I' d like us to have a relationship but we have to pull some strings to make it happen.
Now, here' s what you tell him.
You say...
Well, I bet Mom would have wanted us to meet him before he died.
Wouldn' t she?
Don' t you think?
She was a tough old broad, wasn' t she?
I wouldn' t know.
Excuse me.
Come on.
Oh, that' s right.
We' ve got another body buried here, haven' t we?
Uh, hold on.
Take some of these.
Come on.
So what do you think of this big, old black buck moving in up there?
Who?
Henry Sherman.
You know him?
Yeah.
Is he worth a damn?
I believe so.
What happened to your finger?
Uzi, shh.
It' s okay, I' il tell you.
I' m adopted.
Did you know that?
Well, I am.
When I was 14, I went to find my real family.
They live in lndiana.
All right, now, just set one of them hickory trunks right up top there, sister Maggie.
Did you try to sew it back on?
Wasn' t worth it.
Hell of a damn grave.
Wish it were mine.
It' s a shame, isn' t it?
What?
Well, you probably had another good two or three years of competitive play in you.
Probably.
I had a lot riding on that match, you know.
Financially and personally.
Why did you choke out there that day, Baumer?
Mr. Gandhi leads 40- 15.
That' s 72 unforced errors for Richie Tenenbaum.
He' s playing the worst tennis of his life.
What' s he feeling right now, Tex Hayward?
I don' t know, Jim.
There' s obviously something wrong with him.
He' s taken off his shoes and one of his socks and... actually, I think he' s crying.
I think you' re right.
Who' s he looking at in the friends' box, Tex?
That' s his sister, Margot and her new husband, Raleigh St. Clair.
They were just married yesterday, Jim.
Oh, yes.
I' ve never seen anything like this.
Neither have l.
Strange day out here at Windswept Fields.
I kind of disappeared after that, didn' t l?
Yeah.
But I understood.
I know you' re not very good with disappointment.
You still got that little BB in your hand, Chassie?
Why did you shoot me?
It was the object of the game, wasn' t it?
No.
We were on the same team.
Were we?
Well... you sued me.
Twice.
Got me disbarred.
I don' t hold it against you, do l?
And how is it possible for Mr. Tenenbaum to withdraw these funds without your written authorization?
Objection, Your Honor.
Damn it, I...
Why don' t you leave the objections to me, Royal?
Because I started the corporation when I was a minor.
So, my father was the primary signatory on most of my accounts.
He also stole bonds out of my safety deposit box when I was 14.
You think you could start forgiving me?
Why should l?
Because you' re hurting me.
Come on.
Were you in prison?
Kind of.
Minimum security.
Should we split?
Yes, sir.
No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum.
Okay.
No, I' m kidding; call me Pappy.
Okay.
Come on, let' s shag ass.
Well, just let me know ifyou need somebody to talk to, okay?
I like Raleigh very much.
I know he' s a lot older than you are and you two are having some problems but... anyway, maybe I can help.
Okay.
Thanks.
Hey, Baumer!
All right!
All right!
Oh, shit!
Oh, Jesus.
By the way, I heard about that letter you sent to Eli.
You dropped some cigarettes.
Those aren' t mine.
They just fell out ofyour pocket.
Oh, my Lord, look at you.
Come in.
Did you tell Margot about that letter I wrote to you?
Why?
Did she mention it?
Yes, I did.
Why would she have repeated that, I wonder?
Well, I would ask you the same question.
Rightly so.
What' d you say?
What?
I didn' t say anything.
When?
Right now?
I' m sorry; don' t listen to me.
I' m on mescaline.
Did you say you' re on mescaline?
I did, indeed.
Very much so.
How often do you, uh...?
I' m worried about you, Richie.
Why?
Well, actually, Margot is, for some reason.
But I did find it odd when you said you were in love with her.
She' s married, you know.
Yeah.
And she' s your sister.
Adopted.
Where are my encyclopedias?
They' ve been placed in storage.
Well, damn you.
You' re taking my encyclopedias.
Would you like to make a complaint in writing?
Where am I supposed to go?
You' re turning me into a damn hobo.
I' d be happy to make a reservation for you
- at another hotel.
- You son of a bitch.
Frederick.
Hello there, Dusty.
Hello.
Could you spot me a quarter?
Of course.
Richie?
Hi.
It' s your dad.
lonelier than he lets on maybe lonelier than he even realizes.
Have you spoken to him about this?
Briefly, and he agreed that we...
I' m sorry, maybe I' m a little confused here.
What are you suggesting?
That he come here and stay in my room.
Are you out ofyour mind?
No, I' m not.
Anyway, I think that he' d be much more comfortable here than he would...
Who gives a shit?
I do.
You poor sucker.
You poor, washed- up papa' s boy.
All right, let' s not get out of hand.
Please, don' t get in the middle of this, Mr. Sherman.
This is a family matter.
Don' t talk to him like that.
- Call me Henry.
- I prefer Mr. Sherman.
Call him Henry.
Why?
I don' t know him that well.
You' ve known him for ten years.
As your accountant, Mr. Sherman, yes.
Where are you going to sleep?
I' m just going to camp out upstairs.
We brought our sleeping bag...
Uzi!
We don' t mind, Dad.
We like him.
Who, Pappy?
"Pappy"?
He can sleep in the room above us.
Ari, it' s not your decision.
Nor is it yours.
Well, he' s already up there.
What?!
I guess you can wake him up and throw him out... if Mom says it' s okay.
Get out.
All right.
Let me just collect my things.
Would you mind handing me my cane, Richie?
Let me see, where' s my suitcases?
Dad!
Mom!
Grab me a Nembutal, will you, son?
Are you okay?
What the fuck you care?
Oh, my goodness.
Pagoda?
Call Doctor McClure.
Take a breath and hold it.
Now cough.
His condition is stable.
The attack was just a side effect.
I recommend you push fluids and continue the stomach cancer medication.
Can we move him?
Absolutely not.
For how long?
We' il have to wait and see.
Is he going to be all right?
That depends.
Is he a fighter?
Yeah.
Then that' s the best we' ve got.
Pagoda' s in possession of a parcel containing my will and some instructions for the funeral including my epitaph, for when the time comes.
Proofread it for me before they carve it on the headstone, okay?
Okay.
I never did stop loving you, by the way.
Do you believe that?
Not really.
You look terrific.
That dress is stunning.
Thanks.
Lights out, old man.
I thought I' d read for a while, Chas.
Sorry.
11: 30.
Lights out.
I' m right in the middle of a sentence.
Well, you' il have to finish it in the morning.
Them' s the rules.
Chas?
Good night, my boy. / When the oneyou love says good- bye / / Sing a lullaby / / Dee- dee- dee, dee- dee, dee- dee / / Dee- dee- dee, dee- dee, dee- dee... /
He' s your dad, too, Chas.
- No, he' s not.
- Yes, he is.
You really hate me, don' t you?
No.
I don' t.
I love you.
Well, I don' t know what you think you' re going to get out of this but believe me, whatever it is, it' s not worth it.
Chas...
I don' t want to hurt you.
I know what you and the boys have been through.
You' re my brother, and I love you.
Stop saying that!
What' s that jackass doing?
I know you, asshole!
Did Eli send you that?
He always sends me his clippings.
What for?
I think he just likes the encouragement.
He' s done it for years.
He used to send me his grades in college.
That' s ridiculous.
How long do you intend to stay here?
I don' t know.
Are you ever coming home?
Maybe not.
You' re joking.
No.
Well, I want to die.
Raleigh, please...
Have you met someone else?
I couldn' t even begin to think about knowing how to answer that question.
I don' t like the way you' re treating Raleigh.
What are you talking about?
You don' t even know him.
Well, I' ve met him, and I don' t think he deserves...
Stay out of it.
You' re two- timing him with that bloodsucker
Eli Cash.
Now, that' s just not right, damn it.
You used to be a genius.
No, I didn' t.
Anyway, that' s what they used to say.
Richard, I know you' re terribly close to Margot and probably understand her better than anyone.
May I confide in you?
Okay.
I believe she' s having an affair.
I' m utterly devastated.
I... don' t know where else to turn.
Will you advise me?
I don' t know.
What do you want to do?
I don' t know.
Perhaps, uh...
Find the guy and get him?
Well, no, I thought we could...
Who do you think it might be?
I don' t know at the moment.
I agree with you a hundred percent.
That' s why we have marketing grids.
Hey.
What do you say we go down to Little Tokyo and get some fireworks?
What do you need?
Nothing.
I see you got them, uh, crunching numbers for you.
Please don' t come in this room.
like a pair ofjackrabbits, Etheline.
He has his reasons.
Oh, I know that but you can' t raise boys to be scared of life.
You got to brew some recklessness into them.
I think that' s terrible advice.
No, you don' t.
We take boxing and self- defense classes.
I' m not talking about dance lessons.
I' m talking about putting a brick through the other guy' s windshield.
I' m talking about taking it out and chopping it up.
What do you mean? / The mama pajama rolled out of bed / (all yelling) / And she ran to the police station / / When the papa found out, he began to shout / / And he started the investigation / / It' s against the law /
He saved my life, you know.
30 years ago, I was knifed in a bazaar in Calcutta.
He carried me to the hospital on his back.
Who stabbed you?
He did.
Yeah, there was a price on my head and he was a hired assassin.
Stuck me right in the gut with that.
Shoot.
What?
Where have you been?
Uh, we just stepped out to get some air.
What' s that?
Holy shit.
That' s not...?
What is that?
Oh, no, no, that' s, uh, dog' s blood.
Come here.
What?
You stay away from my children.
Do you understand?
My God, I haven' t been in here for years.
Hey!
Are you listening to me!
Yes, I am!
I think you' ve having a nervous breakdown!
I don' t think you recovered from Rachael' s death.
I...
There you are.
How are you feeling?
I' m having a ball.
Scrapping and yelling and mixing it up.
Loving every minute with this damn crew.
I want to thank you for raising our children by the way.
Okay.
I' m not kidding.
You always put them first, didn' t you?
I tried to.
Lately I feel like maybe I didn' t do such a great job.
Goddamn it, don' t do that to yourself.
I' m the one that failed them.
Or, anyway, it' s nobody' s fault.
Plus, that -- it doesn' t...
Why didn' t you give a damn about us, Royal?
Why didn' t you care?
I don' t know.
I' m ashamed of myself.
I' il tell you one thing, though... you got more grit, fire and guts than any woman I have ever met.
What... what are you smiling about?
Nothing.
No, wha... what' s so funny?
Nothing.
It' s these little expressions ofyours.
I don' t know what you' re talking about but I' il take it as a compliment.
You' re true blue, Ethel.
You really are.
How' s your love life?
None ofyour business.
I' d like you to talk to Royal about us ifyou don' t mind.
I don' t think the timing' s right for that, Henry.
Well, I' d agree if I thought he was really going to die in six weeks but I don' t.
Well, I hopeyou' re right.
Actually, I don' t believe I' il join you tonight.
I' il call you in the morning.
She said that?
Great.
Got the sucker on the ropes.
Can I ask you something, Hank?
Okay.
Are you trying to steal my woman?
I beg your pardon?
You heard me, Coltrane.
Coltrane?
What?
Did you just call me "Coltrane"?
No.
You didn' t?
No.
Okay.
But if I did... you wouldn' t be able to do anything about it, would you?
You don' t think so?
No, I don' t.
Listen, Royal ifyou think you can march in here...
You want to talk some jive?
I' il talk some jive.
I' il talk some jive like you' ve never heard.
- Oh, yeah?
- Right on!
- Sit down.
- What?!
Wh- what did you say?
I said sit down, goddamn it!
Oh, I heard you!
I want you out of my house!
This is not your house!
I want your raggedy ass out!
Don' t talk semantics with me.
Oh, this is not your...
What' s going on here?
Nothing.
Hello, I' m calling in regards to a Dr. McClure -- yes -- at Colby General.
The name of the patient is Royal Tenenbaum.
Is that a Tic- Tac?
How much is he paying you?
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Well, I grew up with the Tenenbaum family, you know.
Right.
Across the street.
They' ve fallen on hard times now, haven' t they?
I can' t say no.
This is bullshit.
Change it, huh?
What did you do to your hand?
Uh, nothing.
Can we get somebody over here to kill these mice for us?
No.
They belong to Chas.
Or anyway, he invented them.
Well, get him to stick them in a fucking cage or something.
Etheline... mind coming up here for a minute, please?
What' s cooking, Pops?
You' il see.
Now, your previous novel...
Yes.
Wildcat.
Right.
Not a success.
Why?
Well, Wildcatwas written in a kind of obsolete vernacular...
Wildcat...
Wild... cat...
Wildcat...
I' m going to go.
I' m taking this off and I' m going.
Stepping out.
What the hell kind of way to act is that?
Open the door.
He' s on drugs.
I' il be right back.
James Bradley...
Hold on a minute, please.
What' s going on?
Pagoda has something to say.
He has a cancer.
No, he doesn' t.
I know what stomach cancer looks like.
I' ve seen it.
And you don' t eat three cheeseburgers a day with French fries if you got it.
The pain is excruciating.
How would you know?
My wife had it.
Not only is there no Dr. McClure at Colby General there is no Colby General.
It closed in 1974.
Aw, shit, man.
Oh, shit, man.
Yes, can you send a taxi to 111 Archer Avenue right away, please?
Thank you.
I guess we' re back out on the street, huh, pal?
Were you part of this, Pagoda?
Of course he was.
No, well, yeah, he was but, I mean, he wasn' t thatinvolved.
Where' d you get all these medical supplies?
A guy at St. Pete' s owed me a favor.
I did some malpractice work for him.
I do have high blood pressure, though.
Look, I know I' m going to be the bad guy on this one.
But I just want to say, the last six days have been the best six days of probably my whole life.
Immediately after making this statement
Royal realized that it was true.
Why' d you do this to us, Royal?
What was the point?
I thought I could win you back.
And then I thought I could get rid of Henry... and at least keep the status quo.
But we hadn' t spoken n seven years.
I know.
Plus, uh...
I was broke.
And I got kicked out of my hotel.
You' re a bastard.
Good- bye, Royal.
Take it easy on those boys, Chassie.
I don' t want this to happen to you.
You know, Richie, this illness, this closeness to death has had a profound effect on me.
l- I feel like a different person, I really do.
Dad, you were never dying.
But I' m going to live.
He' s not your father.
Neither are you.
You son of a bitch!
God.... damn...
That' s the last time you put a knife in me, hear me?
The 375th Street Y, please.
Everyone' s against me.
It' s your fault, man.
Yeah, I know, but damn it, I want this family to love me.
How much money you got?
I don' t have.
What, you' re broke?
You got to be kidding me.
How are we going to pay for this room?
All right, we' il think of something.
I' m not in love with you anymore.
I didn' t know you ever were.
Let' s not make this any more difficult than it already is.
Okay.
Okay, what?
Okay, I' m not in love with you, either.
Yes, I know; you' re in love with Richie which is sick and gross.
Do you send my mother your clippings... and your grades from college?
Please stop belittling me.
You never gave me the time of day till I started getting good reviews.
Your reviews aren' t that good.
But the sales are.
Gentlemen... how much do you already know?
Very little, I' m afraid.
Would you like to examine the report?
Yes.
She smokes.
Yes.
All right, well.
Everything seems to be in order.
I' il contact you in the next 24 hours.
I appreciate that.
Uh, which way are you leaning, by the way?
I' il inform you of my decision at the appropriate time.
Uh, Dusty, put in a good word for us, will you?
I already did.
You want to play some word games or do some experiments on me or anything?
No.
/ He' s wearin 'your clothes / / Head down to toes / / A reaction to you / / You say you know what he did / / But you idiot kid / / You don' t have a clue / / Sometimes they just / / Get caught in the eye / / You' re pulling him through / / Needle in the hay / / Needle in the hay... / (whispering):
Dudley, where is he?
Who?
He' il probably sleep for several hours and then I' il come back to check on him.
All right?
How are you feeling?
Fine, thanks.
Are you in any pain?
Not really.
Why' d you try to kill yourself?
Don' t press him right now.
I wrote a suicide note.
You did?
Yeah.
Right after I regained consciousness.
Can we read it?
No.
Can you paraphrase it for us?
I don' t think so.
Is it dark?
Of course it' s dark.
It' s a suicide note.
All right, that' s enough.
Doctor said to let him sleep.
What?!
Cover for us, will you, Dusty?
Yes.
Yes, Royal.
You' ve made a cuckold of me.
I know.
Many times over.
I' m sorry.
And you nearly killed your poor brother.
What' s he talking about?
It doesn' t matter.
She' s balling Eli Cash.
Oh, my goodness.
May I have a cigarette?
What?
Shall I repeat the question?
You don' t smoke.
I know that.
And a light.
Au revoir.
How long have you been a smoker?
22 years.
Well, I think you should quit.
How can I help?
Let me look at these forms.
Oh, Henry.
Richie Tenenbaum, please.
Your name?
Royal Tenenbaum.
I' m afraid visiting hours are over, sir.
Wh- Wh- What does it say there -- they don' t want me?
l- I' m sorry.
I have to refer you to Dr. Burrows.
He' il be in tomorrow afternoon.
We could shimmy up that gutter jump over that window ledge and then, uh, pry open that ventilator shaft.
There he is.
Richie!
Richie.
Where' s he going?
Richie!
Well, I have to say he didn' t look half bad for a suicide.
Attempted, anyway.
Thanks. / Please / / Give me second grace /
MARGOT:
Hello? / And the clouds will roll by / / And we' il never deny -- / (needle lifts from record) (tentflap opens)
Just listening to some records.
Aren' t you supposed to be in the hospital?
I checked myself out.
How many stitches did you get?
I don' t know.
You want to see?
Jesus. / I tried every way... /
Richie, that looks horrible.
I heard about your ex- husband.
Desmond?
I guess so.
I didn' t get his name.
Yeah.
I met him in the ocean.
I was swimming and he came out to me in a canoe.
We were only married nine days.
And I heard about Eli.
I know.
Poor Eli.
Anyway, they mostly just talked about you.
They did?
Yeah.
I guess that was the attraction, ifyou know what I mean. / She smiled sweetly / / She smiled sweetly / / And says don' t worry... /
What' s that?
I love you.
I love you, too.
I can' t stop thinking about you.
I went away for a year, and it only got worse and I don' t know what to do.
Let' s lie down for a minute.
This is the sleeping bag we took to the museum, isn' t it.
Why' d you do it?
Because of me?
Yeah, but it' s not your fault.
You' re not going to do it again, are you?
I doubt it.
I think we' re just going to have to be secretly in love with each other and leave it at that, Richie.
Lobby floor.
Thank you, sir.
Going up?
Yeah.
What floor, sir?
Doesn' t matter.
So, you' re elevator operators now?
Yeah, just started.
What made you decide to do that?
We' re broke.
I could pay my dues, and whatnot.
I just hope somebody notices.
You asked me why I choked out there that day.
I think I may know the answer and I wanted your advice.
Sure.
Margot Tenenbaum?
Yeah.
Well, since when?
Since always.
Does she know?
Well, what does she feel about that?
I think she feels confused.
Well, I can understand that.
It' s probably illegal.
I don' t think so.
We' re not related by blood.
That' s true.
Still frowned upon.
But then, what isn' t these days, right?
I don' t know, maybe it works.
Why not, what the hell.
You love each other.
Nobody knows what' s going to happen, so...
You know something.
Don' t listen to me.
I never understood her myself.
I never understood any of us.
I wish I could tell you what to do but I just can' t.
That' s okay.
No, it' s not.
You still consider me your father?
Sure, I do.
I wish I had more to offer in that department.
I know you do, Pop.
I don' t blame you, by the way.
Uh, she' s a great- looking girl and smart as a whip.
Mordecai. / Stephanie says that she wants to know / / Why she' s given half her life / / To people she hates now... /
You came back.
That damn bird must have radar in its brain.
Is that true, Mordecai?
l- I' m not so sure this is Mordecai.
What do you mean?
He flew right in here.
This bird has much more white feathers on him.
Oh, the son of a bitch must be molting.
I need your help with something else.
You got it.
What' s the situation?
Well, um, I think Eli maybe...
Hold it.
Pagoda, meet me in the lobby.
Let' s hit it.
I didn' t mean right this second, but... that' s okay.
I don' t think it was Ramses.
I believe it was Tootinkamen.
Tutankhamen.
Tutankhamen?
Yes.
Tutankhamen.
Yes?
Hey, Richie.
We want to take you to get some help.
Is it just you guys?
Would you excuse us, please?
Okay.
Are we still friends?
What do you mean?
Are we?
Of course.
How can you even ask me that?
Well, it doesn' t matter.
It doesn' t matter?
It does matter.
I heard about you and Margot.
I' m sorry.
I don' t know what to say.
You don' t have to say anything.
I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, you know.
Me, too.
Me, too.
'Cause it doesn' t mean what it used to though, does it?
I wish he' d done this for me when I was a kid.
But you didn' t have a drug problem then.
Yeah, but it would' ve meant a lot to me.
Anyway, I' m glad you' re here now.
I recognize that I have a problem... and I want to get better.
I' il just grab my stuff.
There he goes.
What?!
There he goes.
I' d like to order some ice cream for my daughter, please.
What would you like, Margot?
Nothing.
I told you I have to go in five minutes.
I' il have a butterscotch sundae, I guess.
Your brother' s all torn up inside.
Well, so am I, but I' m not going to discuss it with you.
Can' t somebody be a shit their whole life and try to repair the damage?
l- I mean, I think people want to hear that.
Do they?
You probably don' t even know my middle name.
That' s a trick question.
You don' t have one.
Helen.
That was my mother' s name.
I know it was.
Anybody interested in grabbing a couple burgers and hitting the cemetery?
I got something for you, Ethel.
Actually, I made it.
What' s this?
It' s a divorce.
From you?
Yes.
This is Sanchez.
He' s a notary public.
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.
You just sign here and initial here and sign there.
You own this building, don' tyou, Henry?
It' s magnificent.
I used to be a homeowner myself until our son expropriated it from me.
I got to catch my bus.
Thanks, Sanchez.
You' re welcome.
Are we divorced?
Almost.
Sanchez just has to file the papers.
I love you, Etheline.
Congratulations to both ofyou.
I didn' t think so much of him at first.
But now I get it.
He' s everything that I' m not.
Take back Pagoda, will you?
Uh, slightly uneven.
Looks okay.
You' re just nervous.
Henry?
Hello, Richie.
Hi.
This is my son, Walter Sherman.
Hi, Walter.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Henry' s your dad?
Yes.
So you' ve been married before.
Yes.
I' m a widower.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
You know, I' m a widower myself.
I know you are, Chas.
What are you chewing on?
My nicotine inhaler.
It' s supposed to help me quit.
Is it working?
Not really.
Well, of course, I' m half Hebrew but the children are three- quarters Mick Catholic.
So they were raised in the church?
I believe so.
I really don' t know.
Here I come.
Boys!
What was that?
Eli just crashed his car into the front of the house.
Oh, my God.
Where' s my shoe?
Ari, Uzi, where are you?
They' re okay, Chas.
It' s okay.
They' re safe.
They' re safe.
Dad, they ran over Buckley.
What?
Yeah, I think we lost Buckley.
He saved them.
Who?
Dad.
He pulled them out of the way.
You did?
Did I hit anyone?
Is everybody okay?
What' s going on?
Hey, man.
You should try this.
It' s very tasty.
Did I hit the dog?
Yeah.
Is he dead?
Yeah.
I need help.
So do l.
Go around to the other side.
You kids stay there.
We' il be right back.
Can I say something to you, Henry?
Okay.
I' ve always been considered an asshole for about as long as I can remember.
That' s just my style.
But I' d really feel blue if I didn' t think you were going to forgive me.
I don' t think you' re an asshole, Royal.
I just think you' re kind of a son of a bitch.
Well, I really appreciate that.
Could you let us in your backyard, ma' am?
We' ve got a couple boys back there.
I think you may have broken an ankle.
Well, that' s not terribly serious, is it?
Do you have an alternate?
No.
Ready?
Are there priests on call?
Why don' t you bring the car around, Anwar.
At which point, I apparently lost control of the vehicle smashed it into the house, and killed that poor dog.
You' re Eli Cash.
Yes indeed, I am.
I love your work.
Oh, how sweet ofyou to say.
I think he' s part mutt.
What kind of papers do you have for him?
Spark Plug, sit, sit.
Good boy.
Put this on.
What' s so funny, Dudley?
You look great.
Can you see out of it?
Not really.
Minor corneal damage.
Page me if it spreads to the other eye.
But these aren' t structure - bearing elements, Dad.
It doesn' t matter.
It' s still best to file another force majeure and recoup the deductible.
You boys come up here with me.
But Buckley' s still under there.
I know, but there' s nothing we can do for him at the moment.
Come on.
I got you a new dog for the boys.
I just bought him.
You did?
Sorry I let you down, Chas.
All ofyou.
I been trying to make it up to you.
What' s his name?
Spark Plug.
Thankyou.
You' rewelcome.
I' ve had a rough year, Dad.
I know you have, Chassie.
See, now he has more white feathers on his neck.
I wonder what happened to him?
I don' t know.
Sometimes if a person has a traumatic experience their hair turns white.
Well, I' m sure he' il get over it.
This was one of my first hiding places.
How old do you think those are?
I' d say about ten years.
Come here.
Royal dug a hole for Buckley behind the garden shed and buried him in a canvas duffel bag.
All right, boys.
Say a prayer.
Dear Heavenly Father...
Etheline and Henry were married 48 hours later in judge' s chambers.
Margot' s new play was produced at the Cavendish Theatre.
This is my adopted daughter, Elaine Levinson.
It ran forjust under two weeks and received mixed reviews.
Yes, can the boy tell time?
Oh, my Lord, no.
No.
No.
Raleigh and Dudley went on a lecture tour to 11 universities in the promotion of their new book.
Eli checked himself into a rehabilitation hospital in North Dakota.
Oh, hey, this is my sponsor, Runs With Two Horses.
Wind' s blowing up a gale today.
This is the grip that Rod Laver used.
Are you familiar with Laver?
Richie started a program teaching competitive tennis to eight- to- 12 year olds at the 375th Street Y.
Game.
Change sides.
Royal had a heart attack at the age of 68.
Chas rode with him in the ambulance and was the only witness to his father' s death.
In his will, he stipulated that his funeral take place at dusk.
Among the few possessions he left to his heirs was a set of Encyclopedia Britannica in storage at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel under the names Ari and Uzi Tenenbaum.
No one spoke at the funeral and Father Petersen' s leg had not yet mended... but it was agreed among them that Royal would have found the event to be most satisfactory.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!

I deliver perfection... and don' t brag about it!; -)
Come to Los Angeles.
The beaches are wide and inviting.
And the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see.
There are jobs aplenty.
Every workingman can have his own house.
And inside every house, a happy all- American family.
And who knows?
You could even be discovered...... become a movie star, or at least see one.
Life is good in Los Angeles.
lt´s paradise on earth.
That´s what they tell you, anyway.
Because they´re selling an image.
They´re selling it through movies, radio and television.
ln the hit show, Badge of Honor, the L. A. cops walk on water...... as they keep the city clean of crooks.
You´d think this place was the Garden of Eden.
But there´s trouble in paradise...... and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C, to his fans.
Local L. A. color to the nth degree.
And his number one bodyguard...... Johnny Stompanato.
Mickey C´s the head of organized crime in these parts.
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
He kills a dozen people a year.
And the dapper little gent does it in style.
And every time his picture´s on the front page...... it´s a black eye for the image of Los Angeles.
Because how can organized crime exist...... in the city with the best police force in the world?
Something has to be done.
But nothing too original, because, hey, this is Hollywood. what worked for Al Capone would work for the Mickster.
Mr. Cohen, you´re under arrest.
Nonpayment of federal income tax.
But all is not well.
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum.
And it´s only a matter of time...... before someone with balls of brass tries to fill it.
... you heard it here first...... off the record...... on the q. t...... and very...... Hush- Hush. "
You´re like Santa Claus with that list.
Except everyone on it´s been naughty.
Guy´s been out of Q two weeks.
Leave it for later. we´ve got to pick up the booze and get it to the station.
Hollywood, this is 6- Adam- 7.
Have Central send a prowler to 4216 Evergreen.
Parole violation: assault arising from a family dispute. we won´t be here.
They´il see him.
Quit whining!
Quit whining all the time!
It makes me sick!
who the hell are you?
The ghost of Christmas past.
Dance with a man for a change? what are you, a smart ass?
Youll be out in a year and a half.
l´il get cozy with your parole officer.
You touch her again, l´il have you violated on a kiddie raper beef.
You know what they do to kiddie rapers in Quentin.
You have someplace you can go?
Go get yourself fixed up.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, ma´am.
- Let´s go, Bud.
The guys´il be waiting.
what do you do on Badge of Honor?
l´m the technical advisor.
I teach Brett Chase how to walk and talk like a cop.
Brett Chase doesn´t walk and talk like you.
That´s because he´s the television version.
America isn´t ready for the real me.
ls it true you´re the one who arrested Bob Mitchum?
Badge of Honor guys pretend.
But being the real thing must be a thrill. why don´t we go someplace quiet?
l´il give you the lowdown on Mitchum.
Big V. Jack Vincennes.
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.
This is Sid Hudgens with Hush- Hush magazine.
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello yourself.
what´s that about? we did a piece, "lngenue Dikes in Hollywood." Her name got mentioned.
Jackie- boy...... a friend just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.
He´s tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan.
Sorry, I lost you for a second, Sid.
Contract players, Metro.
You pinch them, I do a nice feature next issue.
- Plus the usual $50 cash.
- No, I need another $50.
Two $20´s for two patrolmen, a dime for the Hollywood Station watch commander.
Jackie, it´s Christmas.
No, it´s not.
lt´s felony possession of marijuana.
Actually, it´s circulation 36, 000 and climbing.
There´s no telling where this will go.
Radio, television.
Once you whet the public´s appetite for the truth, the sky´s the limit.
Sergeant Ed Exley, son of the legendary Preston Exley.
Must be a hard act to follow.
why not make a mark somewhere else? why become a cop, Ed?
I like to help people. we heard 2 officers were assaulted this evening. - what do you think about that?
- Goes with the job.
I took the report.
Luckily, they´re okay.
Aren´t you young to be watch commander?
lt´s only tonight.
That´s a good lead for the story.
Merry Christmas, Captain.
- Captain Smith.
- Drop the formalities, Bobby.
- lt´s Christmas Eve, call me Dudley.
- I came up with a title for the story.
l´m calling it "Silent Night with the LAPD."
That´s grand.
Now remember, Bobby, that´s "Smith." with an "S."
Thank you, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas.
Hold on there, lads.
Merry Christmas.
I saw the test results on the lieutenant´s exam.
First out of 23. what´il it be, then?
Patrol Division?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Edmund...... you´re a political animal.
You have the eye for human weakness, but not the stomach.
You´re wrong, sir. would you be willing to plant evidence on a suspect you knew to be guilty...... in order to insure an indictment? - we´ve been over this.
- Yes or no?
No. would you beat a confession out of a suspect you knew to be guilty? would you shoot a hardened criminal in the back...... in order to offset the chance that some lawyer --
Then for the love of God...... don´t be a detective. work where you don´t have to make those kind of choices.
Dudley, I know you mean well...... but I don´t need to do it the way you did... or my father.
At least get rid of the glasses.
I can´t think of a man on the Bureau who wears them.
lf I get held up, you guys better be here.
I need a delivery.
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.
Be right with you.
Merry Christmas to you, officer.
That obvious?
lt´s practically stamped on your forehead.
There you go.
See what he wants, Buzz.
Get lost, why don´t you?
Down!
Get your fucking head down.
I got a license for that.
Cut me some slack.
I used to be a cop.
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.
They call me Buzz.
I don´t give a rat´s ass what they call you.
You okay?
She´s fine.
l´m not asking you, sir.
Somebody hit you?
lt´s not what you think.
what is it, then?
You got the wrong idea, mister.
But it´s nice to know you care.
what´s going on?
You know him?
Yeah, l´ve seen him around.
He used to be a cop.
They´re sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Put your camera right there. when I walk out, l´il stop here.
I like it.
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust." when I walk out, I don´t want your floodlights in my eyes.
Consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?
Get down.
Go!
Pop them!
Freeze!
Police!
Jesus Christ!
Come on.
Come on, let´s go.
My family´s coming in --
- lt´il be a nice Christmas gift.
- Hi, Tammy.
Right over here.
- Just turn.
Got it!
- The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
- Take them in. l´il get the evidence.
"lt´s Christmas Eve in the City of Angels...... and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous...... hopheads prowl for marijuana...... not knowing that a man is coming to stop them:
Celebrity crime- stopper, Jack Vincennes.
Scourge of grasshoppers and dope fiends everywhere. "
You like it?
Yeah, subtle.
what took you?
My partner stopped to help a damsel in distress.
His priorities are all screwed up.
Up to your old tricks again, Bud?
Hollywood Jack, what brings you to our humble station house?
- How are you? - why are you here?
Keeping the streets safe.
Take these two, get them dressed and book them.
- The party´s upstairs.
- Okay, l´il be right up.
what´s that for?
You are watch commander tonight, aren´t you?
Yeah.
So?
A gratuity from Hush- Hush magazine.
Buy yourself some new loafers.
No thanks, Jack.
l´m not interested.
what the hell is this?
The ones who assaulted Brown and Helenowski.
I heard Helenowski bled 6 pints and Brown´s in a coma.
They have bruises and muscle pulls.
lt´s not what I heard.
Get them into lock up.
Stens, you guys hear what those taco benders did to Helenowski and Brown?
Helenowski lost an eye, and they´re reading Brown his last rites.
That ought to make for a very merry Christmas for them.
Guys.
They brought the Mexicans in.
- Let´s do it.
Let´s get them.
Stensland, the party´s upstairs.
Come on, guys.
Haven´t you got work?
Go back to the party.
- Come on, it´s Christmas, help me out.
- Move it!
I just got a few more questions.
You don´t have to be here.
Go!
You better put a leash on your partner before he kills somebody.
Teach him a lesson!
Get him, Stens!
This is for ours, Poncho.
No!
He didn´t do nothing! what are you looking at?
Tell that Mexican to shut up!
Move!
You´re sick!
That´s it!
Don´t break it up.
Get back!
Yeah, and fuck your mother!
Fuck you!
Stop, officer!
That´s an order!
You´il all be in my report!
"Bloody Christmas."
The press love to label.
You should know this is bigger than the police board.
The grand jury´s convening.
lndictments may be handed down. will you testify?
No, sir.
District Attorney Loew?
You and officer Stensland brought the liquor to the station.
Stensland was already drunk.
Appearing as a voluntary witness against him...... could offset damage to yourself.
This man is a disgrace.
Your badge and gun, officer.
You´re suspended from duty.
Dismissed.
we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department.
Justice has to be served.
Of course l´il testify.
Most don´t.
They think silence and integrity are the same thing.
Not exactly the image of the...... new LAPD we´re trying to create. welcome to Los Angeles, the city of the future.
- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- By all means.
The public will expect the Department to sweep this under the carpet.
Don´t.
Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.
Force them to retire.
But somebody has to swing.
So indict, try and convict...... Richard Stensland and Bud white.
The message will be clear.
This Department...... will not tolerate officers who think they´re above the law.
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment as a policeman.
He´s had rotten fitness reports from every C. O. he´s served under.
But Bud white is a valuable officer. white´s a mindless thug.
No, Edmund...... but he can answer "yes" to those questions l´ve asked you before.
The Department and the public need role models.
Clean- cut, forthright men the public can admire.
Sergeant...... l´il promote you...... to lieutenant...... effective immediately.
Detective Lieutenant.
Ed, you´re 30.
Your father didn´t make lieutenant till he was 33.
I know that, sir. when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Before we start polishing our laurels...... it´d look better if we had a corroborative witness.
That won´t be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.
Jack Vincennes.
He hit one of the Mexicans.
A veteran like Vincennes might be willing to admit his own culpability...... but he´d never rat out a fellow officer.
Jack´s the technical advisor on Badge of Honor.
He lives for it.
That´s how to get to him.
l´d like you to observe, Ed.
Bright kid.
You may reap the benefit...... but are you ready to be despised in the Department?
Yes, sir, I am.
So be it.
Sergeant, we´il get right to it.
Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.
But we have a witness who will name names and testify that you hit back...... only after being hit.
You will testify against 3 officers...... who have earned their pensions and plead ignorance about the rest.
No thanks.
l´il guarantee you a slap on the wrist, a brief suspension...... followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Vice.
You transfer out of Vice, you´il be back on the show.
The show?
Badge of Honor, Vincennes.
we need to tone down your profile for a bit.
I doubt you´ve ever taken a stupid breath.
Don´t start now.
Okay, l´il do it.
The grand jury will hear...... your testimony tomorrow.
And so it goes...... Detective Lieutenant.
Ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son. wear a smart- looking suit and ace them.
And Ed...... lose the glasses.
So you´re the stellar witness.
I should have known. what´s the Chief throwing you?
Throwing me?
Yeah, Exley, what´s the payoff?
You´re the payoff expert.
l´m just doing my duty.
Come on, you´re playing an angle here, college boy.
You´il get something so you don´t have to hobnob with the cops...... who´il hate you for snitching.
lf they´re making you detective, watch out.
Some Bureau guys will burn in this and you´il be working with their friends. what about you?
l´m snitching 3 old- timers who´il be fishing in Oregon next week.
Next to you, l´m clean...... and smart.
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.
And remember...... Bud white will fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Dudley...... what do you want?
Look, lad, I admire your refusal to testify...... and your loyalty to your partner.
I admire you as a policeman...... and your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.
l´m impressed with your punishment of women- beaters.
Do you hate them, wendell?
what do you want?
They´re yours.
Take them.
- 4 witnesses recanted their testimony. - why?
They had a change of heart.
Stensland?
Your partner´s through.
Scapegoat on the Chief´s orders.
A year from his pension.
- Exley!
- Exley got what he wanted.
As a politician he exceeds even myself.
The Department needs smart men like Exley...... and direct men...... like you.
Look, I need you for an assignment the Chief´s given me.
A duty few men are fit for...... but you were born for.
You´d be working out of Homicide at City Hall.
Homicide? working cases?
lt´s a muscle job.
You´il do as I say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?
ln Technicolor, sir.
"Meet Tony Brancato and Anthony Trombino...... two rising lieutenants in the Mickey Cohen rackets. with the dapper little gent in prison...... who knows how far they´il go.
The sky´s the limit.
Oh, well. "
"Meet Deuce Perkins, Mickey Cohen´s narcotics lieutenant.
Could he be behind the hits?
ls he consolidating organized crime power?
One thing´s for sure:
2- man triggers are punching the tickets on the Mickster´s muscle. "
"Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD...... has set up a not- so- welcome wagon to dishearten the criminal element...... from filling the void left by Mickey´s absence. when I know more, dear readers, so will you.
Off the record, on the q. t...... and very...... Hush- Hush. "
with Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime- free.
The Chief wants to keep it that way.
ln Cleveland, you´re an organized crime associate...... in desperate need of re- education in the ways of polite society.
I hear things.
Like those 2- men shooter teams.
They´re 86ing Cohen´s lieutenants. what do you want? we want you to go home.
Picture- book smut, men.
There´s been a bunch of this found at crime scenes lately.
Quality ranges from piss- poor to...... very well done.
Look at that.
ls there someplace you´d rather be?
Yeah, working Narcotics, looking for Cohen´s missing H.
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin would get you plenty of ink.
You should´ve thought of that before Bloody Christmas.
Make a major case. lt´s the only way you´il get out of here.
Dismissed, gentlemen.
Go get the facts, Jack.
Just the facts.
whatever you desire.
Hi. l´d like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills.
I don´t know you.
A friend just gave me this number and I wanted to find out if -- would you grab a reverse directory and shag a name and address for me?
Crestview- 2239.
Hush- Hush, off the record and on the q. t.
Sid, it´s Vincennes.
Jackie, you back on narco?
I need some good copy.
I have something going with Vice.
Something juicy for the Sidster?
Arty, high- class stuff.
Know about Fleur- de- Lis?
Slogan´s "whatever you desire."
No, l´ve heard bupkes.
Get me some narco skinny.
I want to do an all- hophead issue.
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.
l´il talk to you later. - what do you got?
- The number´s not assigned.
Thanks, Ginger.
A bootleg.
Take it easy.
Tough break, Stens. we´re going to miss you.
Raw deal, Stensland.
Here comes the snitch.
Sorry about that, Lieutenant.
Stay out of trouble, Bud.
I got a few hours.
l´il buy you a drink.
Rain check.
I got a hot date.
who is she and what did you arrest her for?
lt´s confidential.
Like that magazine that Vincennes scams for.
Hush- Hush.
l´il see you later in the week. we´il do the town, on me.
Yeah. l´il bring my wallet just in case.
- See you tomorrow.
- Hang on!
l´il walk down with you.
Punk kid. who is he trying to impress?
Got himself a real career going.
Sergeant williams, pick up, please.
Sergeant williams?
ls there anybody up there in Homicide?
Anybody there?
Lieutenant Exley.
You´ve got a homicide downtown.
- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
- I got it.
At least one person´s dead.
I stopped for coffee.
No one comes through the front door.
Understand?
I want barricades at both ends of the street.
I took the call. lt´s my case.
You don´t want it and you can´t have it.
I took the call.
lt´s mine.
l´il make you my second- in- command.
Captain, over here, please.
The cook drew a gun and set it off.
The rest died in the men´s room.
Sir...... we got a total of 15 spent 12- gauge Remington shotgun shells.
l´m betting 3 men, 5- shot capacity pumps, all of them emptying once.
Excuse me, we got an l. D. on one of the victims.
lt´s Dick Stensland.
At first, I thought she was Rita Hayworth.
Yeah, me too.
what happened?
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.
The guy at the register pulled a. 38, so they killed him.
Then they killed everyone else.
Lieutenant, we´re ready with that Nite Owl l. D.
ls this your daughter?
I don´t know. we know this is difficult.
It seems like my Susan.
But my Susan was a blonde, not a redhead. when was the last time you saw her?
Just before Christmas. we´d fought.
I didn´t like her boyfriend.
Mrs. Lefferts...... does your daughter have any distinguishing marks?
You got the wrong idea, mister.
She has a birthmark on her hip.
lt´s her.
My baby!
l´m sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.
who´s in charge of this investigation?
Captain Smith and myself. why?
Six victims.
One of them, one of our own.
Dick Stensland.
He was a Nite Owl regular, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Robbery is the likely motive. we have rubber glove smears on the register and forensics...... tend toward a trio of shooters. we do have one hot lead.
Three Negro juveniles...... were seen discharging shotguns in Griffith Park.
A park ranger l. D. ´d them as driving a 1948- 1950 Mercury coupe...... maroon in color.
An hour ago a canvassing crew found a news vendor...... who saw a maroon Merc coupe parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a. m.
DMV has come up with a registration list of Merc coupes.
48 two- man teams will shake three names apiece.
lnterrogations will be led by Lt. Edmund Exley.
Enough on that!
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.
Dismissed.
why not just put a bounty on them?
- Ready to roll?
- You take them, I got something to do. what if one of these names --?
Get somebody else.
I got our assignments, Big V. we go by this list, we got zero chance of making this collar.
I got a guy who knows what happens south of Jefferson.
He´il put us at 50- 50. what are you doing?
lt´s the same sort of thing that got you in trouble before.
l´il take those odds.
we got it from here.
You two should bring along a photographer.
Her name is Lynn.
- That´s all I got to go on?
- Yeah.
You already know who I mean, so cough it up.
There´s a billing address and a delivery address.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I am.
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called my office.
Go on down to the driveway. we´il talk there.
what can I do for you? - where were you last night?
Tell me about Dick Stensland.
I don´t know him, Mr. --?
Officer white.
You know Sue Lefferts?
You saw me with her.
How did you find me?
Nick´s Liquor.
This is where Lynn Bracken´s booze bills go.
Of course.
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
Everything all right?
Fine, Phillip, thank you.
what happened to the other guy, Buzz?
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.
Lefferts looked beat- up Christmas Eve but didn´t act it. why?
I think she´d been hit in the face with a tennis racket.
She is... was...... a big doubles fan.
You´re a known associate of a woman killed in a mass murder.
- want to go downtown to discuss this?
- ls this official?
Somehow I have the feeling this is more personal with you.
All right, then...... are you concerned about criminal matters peripheral to the murders?
- You´re not obligated to report them?
why were Lefferts´ eyes black?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio. what little studio? well, there´s Gardner, Russell, Monroe, Turner....
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.
I use girls that look like movie stars.
Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon. when the work was done, that´s when you saw us.
lt´s why her mom couldn´t l. D. her.
Jesus fucking Christ!
No, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.
I sense you´re on your best behavior, but that´s all l´m saying.
lf you persist, we´il meet with my attorney.
would you like Lynn Bracken´s address?
I got her address.
Find Susan´s killer, Mr. white.
l´il give you a handsome reward.
whatever you desire!
I know you´re not asleep.
what do you want?
My 5 bucks.
It was the only one I had.
Right now?
Hey, doll face, tell him to leave us alone.
I understand.
Okay, fine.
Oh, baby...... bad news.
Go?
Something very important has come up and you have to go.
l´il make it up to you.
I will, I promise.
Excuse me.
ls it the cops?
Miss Bracken...... l´m Officer white.
l´ve been expecting you, just not this soon.
He told me what happened to Sue.
Everything all right, doll? want me to get rid of him?
Hit the road.
LAPD.
Get out of here or l´il have your wife come get you.
- Officer.
- Councilman.
- would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren´t friends.
Know what I mean?
You sorry she´s dead?
Of course I am. what kind of question is that?
Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Use words like that, you might make me mad.
But, do you know?
Patchett´s running whores...... cut to look like movie stars.
And, judging by his address, something bigger on the side.
He doesn´t want any attention.
That´s right.
Our motives are selfish so we´re cooperating.
So cooperate. why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don´t know.
I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
How´d she meet Patchett?
Pierce meets people.
Sue had dreams of Hollywood and this is how they turned out.
Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Tell me about Pierce.
He´s waiting for you to mention money.
want advice, Miss Bracken?
Miss Bracken...... don´t ever try to fucking bribe me...... or l´il have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.
You have a thing for helping women, don´t you?
Maybe l´m just fucking curious.
- You say "fuck" a lot.
- You fuck for money.
There´s blood on your shirt.
An integral part of your job?
- Yeah.
- Do you enjoy it? when they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
l´m not sure.
- But you did it anyway.
- Yeah.
Like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Actually, it was only two.
You´re different, Officer white.
You´re the first man in years who didn´t tell me I look like Veronica Lake.
You look better than Veronica Lake.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.
He doesn´t let us use narcotics and he doesn´t abuse us.
Can your policeman´s mentality grasp those contradictions?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake.
No.
l´m really a brunette, but the rest is me.
And that´s all the news that´s fit to print.
lt´s nice meeting you.
- l´d like to see you again.
- For a date...... or an appointment?
I don´t know.
- For a date, l´d know your first name.
It was a mistake.
Leonard Bidwell?
Come down here and talk to us.
How´s the left these days? what´s it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.
I like your style.
what do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You got a brother in Folsom.
I put him there.
Until 1970.
How´d you like to make it 1960?
I know the judge, and Lieutenant Exley...... is good friends with the D. A. we´re looking for 3 colored guys who like to shoot shotguns.
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe. - want me to snitch? - want to buy your brother 10 years?
- It was 10 years, right?
- Yeah, 10 years.
You don´t have to say anything, just look at this list...... and point.
He´s bad, so l´il just tell you.
Drives a maroon ´49 coupe.
Beautiful ride.
Don´t know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs.
He´s righteous trash.
Look at that. lt´s five minutes from here.
Thanks.
l´il hear from you...... about my brother?
Keep it up, Lenny.
There it is.
lt´s in the back.
- One of ours.
- Shit, somebody beat us here!
Damn it!
My glasses!
You´re kidding!
well, just don´t shoot me.
what are you doing here? we were in the neighborhood. - what do you got?
- Three 12- gauge pumps.
And cash.
Badge of Honor, here I come.
Fuck you!
This is our collar.
Quiet!
l´m ranking officer here. we go as a team.
Right.
Only one.
Up the stairs.
He´s very serious.
Police!
Don´t shoot!
- Don´t move.
- Ace him, Jack!
Anxious, aren´t you?
Don´t kill them.
Back, back, back!
Get off me!
Against the wall!
- Put your hands up!
- Get over there.
Shut up!
Hands behind your back!
So...... how´s it feel getting out of the office?
This came from forensics.
Casitas Youth Camp.... "
lt´s crowded in here, white.
These guys killed Stensland.
The ejection marks on the shells fired from the shotguns...... are identical to those on the shell casings found at the Nite Owl.
I want confessions, Edmund.
A night´s stewing has softened them up.
l´il break them, sir.
Are you sure golden boy is up to the task, Cap?
I think you´d be surprised what the lad is capable of.
You´re 22.
Did an officer work you over?
- You´re 22, right? - why do you keep asking that?
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.
You should´ve pulled this caper years ago.
Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt...... transfer to Folsom a big man...... get yourself a sissy....
I don´t truck with no sissies.
Louis. what?
You did the Casitas Youth Camp with Louis. why you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.
Sugar, Louis told me you went sissy up at Casitas.
You couldn´t do the time, so you got a big white boy to look after you.
Said they called you "Sugar"...... because you gave it out so sweet.
Louis gave it up at Casitas.
I was the boss jock in my dorm!
Louis was the sissy!
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
He ain´t got the sense of a dog!
You like to shoot dogs.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Feel the same way about people? what´re you trying to say? we got the shotguns.
I don´t own no shotguns. why were you throwing clothes in the incinerator?
Say what?
A neighbor said she saw you throwing clothes in the incinerator.
Doesn´t look good.
I ain´t talking till I see a judge. were you on hop?
You were passed out when we arrested you.
Ty and Louis fuck with that shit, not me. where do they get their stuff?
Man....
Give me one to feed the D. A. lt´il make me look good...... and l´il say Sugar Ray´s not a punk like his sissy partners.
Tell me one more thing about Jones and Fontaine. where do they get drugs?
Roland Navarette.
He runs a hole- up on Bunker Hill.
And he sells red devils.
Exley´s good, l´il give him that.
l´il take a break.
You know, Ray, l´m talking about the gas chamber...... and you haven´t asked me what this is about.
You got a big "guilty" sign around your neck.
That was masterful, Edmund.
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.
Take the cuffs off, so he can read it.
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.
I think it was Ray´s idea.
You talk, I think I can save your life.
6 people are dead, and someone has to pay for it.
Now, it can be you, or it can be Ray.
Louis, he called you queer.
- At Casitas, you took it up the ass.
- I didn´t kill nobody!!
Son...... you know what´il happen if you don´t talk.
You´il go to the gas chamber.
So admit what you did.
I didn´t mean to hurt her.
- Maybe she´s okay.
They´re all in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don´t die, so I don´t die.
She don´t die, so I don´t die.
Louis, who´s the girl? what´s her name? who are you talking about? was she at the Nite Owl?
Listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?
- This paper shit ain´t shit! - where´s the girl?
You kill her?
Louis lost his cherry, but things got out of hand.
You made her bleed.
She bled on your clothes, so you burned the clothes. who said that?!
Now, listen to me.
lf she´s alive, she´s the only chance you´ve got.
- I think she´s alive.
- You think? where is she now?
Did you leave her someplace?
where is she?
what´re you doing?!
Don´t. white!
1 in 6! where´s the girl?!
Put the weapon down! where´s the girl?!!
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...... brown corner house, upstairs.
- Just give me one minute.
- You got it.
Nobody moves. we´re going in the front.
Stay put until I give the word.
He went around back!
l´m Lieutenant Exley.
l´m sorry to ask you this.
I need to know when they left you.
Get her to the hospital.
Give your career a rest.
Leave her alone.
A naked guy with a gun? who´il believe that?
Get the fuck away from me.
How´il it look in your report?
lt´il look like justice.
That´s what the man got.
Justice.
You don´t know the meaning of the word.
Go after criminals for a change.
Stensland got what he deserved and so will you.
lt´s best to stay away when his blood is up.
His blood´s always up.
Perhaps you should stay away from him altogether.
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones and Louis Fontaine.
They are considered armed and dangerous.
The Nite Owl suspects have escaped.
How´d they get out the window?
They jumped from the 2nd floor.
Girl said they left her at 12.
They could get to the Nite Owl by 1.
The question was, where did they get their drugs?
I haven´t gotten that far yet.
"Roland Navarette lives on Bunker Hill, runs a hole- up --"
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?
ls something up?
I need some backup.
- Nothing.
404.
Nobody moves!
You´re under arrest.
Don´t shoot, man!
Don´t move!
Don´t move!
There he is.
You did good, kid.
You should´ve seen this place.
Shotgun Ed.
Somebody get him cleaned up.
Come on.
Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record...... in his 7 years with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Recently, he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.
It is our privilege to present him with our highest honor:
The Medal of Valor. - what kind of car was it?
- It was a Ford.
I know what they look like.
Excuse me, ma´am.
Just the facts.
Light or dark?
Light.
And that´s really all I remember, Officer.
Thank you.
You´ve been a big help.
Cut!
That´s a print.
Big Jack!
He´s back!
Jack´s back.
Tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote.
It may surprise some that an official would admit to making a mistake...... but after due consideration...... l am changing my position on the matter before the council.
"Go west, America," was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.
Today is that last step westward with no stop signs...... no traffic signals, from downtown...... to the beach in 20 minutes.
what were you going to start with?
Gambling?
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels...... and you haven´t got any wings.
Nice to see you again.
Take care.
I wondered when you´d knock on my door again, Officer white.
lt´s Bud.
Bud.
why me?
I don´t know.
This election...... is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles.
City Councilman Rogers represents that future.
So let´s dig deep...... and get a moral man re- elected.
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.
Thank you, Brett Chase.
The talented star of Badge of Honor.
Let me tell you, I am so thrilled to be here.
Big V.
Good to see you back.
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.
You tight with the D. A., Jackie?
Yeah.
He tried to throw me off the force last Christmas.
How about some payback, big- time?
Plus the usual 50 dollar donation to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.
- Did you know the D. A. was a swish?
- No kidding?
Remember Matt Reynolds?
Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?
- He just got off the honor farm. - what´s he doing here?
Reynolds is acey- deucey, not to mention broke.
l´m getting him to fuck the D. A. for $100.
That´s twice the $50 you got for wrecking his career.
- Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don´t bring him --
That´s D. A. Loew right there.
You need a drink?
Yeah.
Look after him.
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.
- l´m okay.
How´re you?
l´m good.
Have we met before?
Yeah.
was it at a party?
It was something like that.
Right.
Fleur- de- Lis. "whatever you desire."
Dope, hookers that look like movie stars....
Pierce Patchett has it all.
Pierce, he´s not like regular guys.
I dig him, but...... you know...... he scares me too.
How?
when I came out to L. A. this isn´t exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Yeah, well...... get in line.
Your courage, kid.
Drink up.
I don´t think I should do this.
lt´s not like you don´t know how.
Jack´s connected to Badge of Honor.
Pull this off, you´il get a part.
I smell a comeback, don´t you, Jack?
Go introduce yourself.
Tell him about the opening on the show.
l´m pretty sure I can get you a part on this show.
But...... that´s later on.
Tonight, go on over there and pretend it´s an acting job.
Like show biz.
Acting, that´s it.
Right.
No one´s going to know about this?
No.
lt´il be our secret.
- Show biz.
- That´s it.
Show biz.
lf Reynolds works his charms, which I know he will...... they´il be at the Hollywood Center Motel, room 203.
Meet me there at midnight for a photo shoot.
And maybe we can work in the Hollywood sign this time.
what do you know about Pierce Patchett?
I know what you know.
I just keep hearing rumors, you know.
High- class porn, drugs, hookers that look like movie stars.
Patchett´s what I call twilight.
He ain´t queer or Red.
He cannot help me in my quest for prime sinnuendo.
As though Badge of Honor would touch that guy with a 10- foot pole...... after he´s been Hush- Hush cover boy twice in one year.
See you soon.
Midnight.
Another?
Yeah.
Come on, you don´t have to do this --
Thank you for what you did for me...... for killing those animals who raped me. will you thank Officer white for me, please?
Sure.
Seeing him come through the door is about the only thing I remember.
You remember what time the Negroes left you, right?
ln your statement, you said they left you at midnight.
They might have.
They "might" have?
I don´t know what time they left me.
I wanted them dead. would anyone care that they raped a Mexican girl...... if they hadn´t killed those white people at the Nite Owl?
I did what I had to do for justice.
Smile, lnez.
ls he your hero?
Fellas, how about this?
"Rape Victim wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero."
All they get is Veronica Lake.
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.
"Bisbee?"
I grew up there.
The girls in Bisbee need a little glamour.
where´d this come from?
I was 12.
I got in the way.
So you saved her.
Not for long.
- l´m sorry. lt´s none of my business.
- He tied me to the radiator.
I watched him beat my mother to death with a tire iron...... and he left me there.
Three days before a truant officer found us.
They never found the old man.
ls that why you became a cop?
To get even?
Maybe.
Do you like it?
I used to.
Now it´s all strong- arm, sitting duck stuff.
lf I could...... get a chance to work Homicide...... like a real detective....
That prick, Exley, he shot the wrong guys. whoever killed Stensland´s still around.
I know it in here.
I know it.
Something´s wrong with the Nite Owl.
I just can´t prove it, that´s all.
l´m not smart enough.
You´re wrong.
You found Patchett.
You found me.
You´re smart enough.
Bud white! what brings you down to the basement?
I got a couple of Nite Owl questions.
Don´t know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Anything bother you about it?
The suspects´ 3 shotguns match the strike marks on the shell casings.
what more do you want?
There´s blood on the wall here.
I thought everyone got shot in the men´s room.
That is Stensland´s blood.
Blow to the head.
Probably unconscious when they dragged him in the john.
Did they hit anyone else?
No, but he was a cop.
Probably tried to do something.
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone was sitting next to him.
2 victims were women?
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.
Susan Lefferts.
Yeah, what about her?
You´re welcome!
Mrs. Lefferts?
l´m Officer white, LAPD.
Tell me about the boyfriend you mentioned at the coroner´s office.
I told you I didn´t approve of that boyfriend.
He was too old for you.
And you let him be fresh with me.
They came here one day when I wasn´t home.
Mrs. Jensen next door said...... she saw Susie´s boyfriend and another man and...... she heard a ruckus. what was his name? we weren´t properly introduced.
Susie gave him a nickname, Muns or Luns.
Stens? was it Stens?
Maybe.
I don´t know.
Look.
That´s him.
That´s him.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. was it outside?
Outside.
And then Mrs. Jensen said they kept going under the house.
You have to leave now, officer.
- what´s through here?
- Just a room full of old things.
Don´t move that!
Don´t mind the smell.
I think a rat died behind the wall.
My Susie was a good girl.
She was never in any kind of trouble at all!
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.
was it a rat?
Yeah, a great big one.
Here.
Compliments of the Police Department.
Unemployed actor had frankfurter, french fries, alcohol and sperm.
Hell of a last supper, don´t you think?
Anything bothering you about the Nite Owl case?
That you guys won´t let it get filed away.
- what do you mean?
- Bud white grilled me on it today.
Bud white?
He´s not as dumb as I thought.
Did he say where he was going after he talked to you?
Let my daughter rest in peace!
Mrs. Lefferts, I want to ask a few questions.
Officer white already checked under the house.
Under the house? - where?
- Out back.
All he found was rodents.
I need an l. D. on this as soon as possible.
Talk only to me on this one.
I need your help.
l´m busy right now. why don´t you ask your boys in Homicide?
I can´t.
I need someone outside of Homicide.
Tail Bud white until he goes on duty this evening.
Do me a real favor and leave me alone.
You make the Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
what?
lt´s a simple question.
why in the world do you want to dig deeper...... into the Nite Owl killings...... Lieutenant?
Rollo Tomasi.
ls there more or do I have to guess?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.
My father ran into him off- duty.
He shot my father 6 times and got away clean.
No one knew who he was.
I made the name up to give him personality.
what´s your point?
Rollo Tomasi´s the reason I became a cop.
I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.
It was supposed to be about justice.
Then somewhere along the way I lost sight of that.
why´d you become a cop?
I don´t remember.
what do you want, Exley?
I want to solve this thing.
Nite Owl was solved.
No.
I want to do it right.
Even if it means paying the consequences?
All right, college boy, l´il help.
But there´s a case your boys in Homicide don´t care about.
They think it´s just another Hollywood "homo" - cide.
But I don´t.
Deal?
Johnny Stompanato.
How´s tricks, paesano?
I ain´t your paesano.
I ain´t in the snitch business anymore.
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?
works for Pierce Patchett.
Should l?
You´re muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.
You tell me.
Yeah, I remember now.
Meeks is a run- down ex- cop.
Same as you´re going to be some day.
That´s all you´il get.
Keep your 20 bucks.
what do I get if I give you your balls back, you wop cocksucker?
There was a rumor going around...... that Meeks had a line on a large supply of H.
And?
And nothing!
He skipped out.
Bullshit.
How would Meeks get his hands on a large supply of heroin?
You´re right.
lt´s probably bullshit.
Even if he did, he could never unload it.
Not without drawing all kinds of attention.
Maybe that´s why he´s under a house in Elysian Park not smelling too good...... paesano.
we got Rita Hayworth at the morgue, and now Veronica Lake with white.
I think your case and my case are connected. lt´s Fleur- de- Lis again.
Fleur- de- Lis?
"whatever you desire."
High- class whores cut to look like movie stars. who knows what else.
So is Pierce Patchett.
The millionaire?
I think we should go talk to him.
First I want to brace Stompanato.
want an autograph? write to MGM.
Since when do two- bit hoods and hookers give out autographs? what?
LAPD.
Sit down. who in the hell do you think you are?
Take a walk, honey.
- You are making a large mistake.
- Get away from our table.
Shut up.
A hooker cut to look like Lana Turner is still a hooker.
- She just looks like Lana Turner.
- She is Lana Turner.
She is Lana Turner.
How was I supposed to know?
I believe the Nite Owl´s your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.
I saw you on television getting your medal.
And you´re...... that other Hollywood celebrity policeman, aren´t you?
The Veronica Lake look- alike works for you.
She´s one of your whores.
A vulgar term. why´s she seeing Bud white? why do men and women usually see each other?
Let´s try this on for size:
Fleur- de- Lis. "whatever you desire."
An actor named...... Matt Reynolds.
No?
Nothing?
we want some answers.
we all want something.
The guy´s as cool as they come.
Lieutenant Exley, come in, please.
Exley.
The coroner wants to talk to you.
He says he has your l. D.
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him.
- l´il drop you at your car. - where are you going?
Lynn Bracken´s.
To find out why Patchett has her seeing Bud white.
See you at the Frolic Room.
Oh, great.
I get the coroner.
Hush- Hush, off the record and on the q. t.
I was just coming up to see you.
You get that l. D.?
Thank God for dental records.
Leland Meeks.
Buzz Meeks?
- You knew him?
- Of him.
He was around when I joined the force.
Thanks.
"Just the facts," Jack.
"Just the facts."
Anything else?
Leland Meeks worked Vice ´39- ´41.
I need to see his arrest records.
Miss Bracken...... l´m Lieutenant Exley.
I know.
Bud told me all about you.
ls that so?
And what did white have to say?
He said you were smart.
He also said you were a coward, and that you´d screw yourself to get ahead.
Let´s concentrate on my smarts.
Pierce Patchett made you, didn´t he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.
I am very impressed with the results.
But I need answers.
And if I don´t get them, l´il take you and Patchett down.
Pierce Patchett can take care of himself.
And l´m not afraid of you.
And you forget one thing, Lieutenant...... Pierce also taught me how to fuck.
And he tells you who to fuck. why does he have you fucking Bud white? what makes you think l´m not seeing Bud because I want to?
It would be easier for you if there was an angle, wouldn´t it?
You´re afraid of Bud because you can´t figure out how to play him.
He doesn´t follow the same rules of politics as you do.
It makes him dangerous.
I can handle Bud white.
I see Bud because I want to.
I see Bud because he can´t hide the good inside of him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken...... and not some Veronica Lake look- alike who fucks for money.
I see Bud because he doesn´t know how to disguise who he is.
I see Bud for all the ways he´s different from you.
Don´t underestimate me.
The way you´ve underestimated Bud white?
Fucking me and fucking Bud aren´t the same thing.
Stop talking about Bud white.
Come on.
Jack Vincennes.
lt´s going on midnight.
I need 2 minutes, Dudley.
lt´s important.
Good thing for you my wife and daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
Do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
A disgrace as a police officer.
Straight D fitness reports from every C. O. he ever served under. why?
12 years ago, he was on a Vice roust with Dick Stensland.
They questioned Pierce Patchett about a blackmail scam.
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing prominent businessmen with hookers.
Anyway, charges were dropped.
lnsufficient evidence.
You were the supervising officer on that case.
It has to do with a murder l´ve been working with Ed Exley on.
You´re Narco, Jack, not Homicide.
Since when do you work with Edmund Exley?
lt´s a private investigation.
l´m trying to make amends.
Don´t start trying to do the right thing, boyo.
You haven´t had the practice.
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.
So, what does Exley make of this?
I haven´t told him yet.
I just came from the records room.
Have you a valediction, boyo?
Rollo...... Tomasi.
Sergeant Vincennes was killed by a. 32 slug to the heart.
Time of death, approximately 1 a. m.
Although he was found in Echo Park, forensics indicates the body was moved.
I want 2- man teams to scour that entire neighborhood.
Our justice must be swift...... and merciless.
That is all.
Might I have a word with you?
we´re trying to run down a lead on an associate of Vincennes.
The records check has led to a dead end. what´s the name?
Rollo Tomasi?
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?
No.
No, I haven´t.
lt´s probably nothing.
Still...... keep your eyes open, boyo.
I know it´s unlikely, but suppose, just for a moment...... somebody had a lot of heroin, who would they go to to move it? white, in my office.
Captain.
Look, just give me a name.
Mickey Cohen.
Captain?
I could use your fearsome habits at the Victory Motel.
Now.
Close the door, lad.
You´re a bit of a puzzlement to me these days.
You don´t seem your old cruel self.
And I had such grand plans for your future. what plans?
You have your extracurricular activities and I have mine.
we must have a clarification session one of these days.
However...... right now...... we´il brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes.
So the question is...... can I count on you, lad?
- Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.
I want to know everything you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night.
Start with the l. D. on the corpse.
An ex- cop.
An ex- cop?
Did Jack know him?
Only by reputation.
This is Sid Hudgens.
l´m willing to cooperate.
No need to tie me down.
lt´s for your own safety. what can you tell us about Jack Vincennes?
Hollywood Jack?
I can tell you he´s on the night train to the Big Adios.
I had nothing to do with him getting killed, if that´s what you mean.
- But you were business associates. - what´s that got to do with anything?
Okay, so we worked together.
It was an information exchange.
I got him first- class collars, he got me good stories. we were friends. we´il drop that for the moment.
Care to comment on Pierce Patchett?
You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced? wendell, l´d like full and docile cooperation on every topic.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Everyone knows Patchett´s worth a boatload of greenbacks.
But the man has hobbies too.
He bankrolls B movies under the table.
He´s rumored to be a heroin sniffer.
All in all, a powerful behind- the- scenes strange- o.
And?
And what?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is the key to every relationship.
He runs call girls.
Primo tail fixed up to look like movie stars.
And?
Blackmail shit.
ln my car, in the trunk, under the rug....
Patchett got me to photograph this cop screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.
She looks like Veronica Lake.
I said leave him be!
Get him away from me!
Back off!
Back off!
I wouldn´t trade places with Exley right now for all the whiskey in lreland.
Dudley, I thought you were going to let the dumb bastard kill me!
Learn to pull your punches a little better.
You can uncuff me now, fellas.
Fellas...... we had a deal.
You, me, Patchett, we´re a team.
Hush- hush.
- Anything?
- Nothing.
Meeks never made an arrest the entire time he worked Vice?
Someone must´ve pulled the files.
what about the daily report books?
They´d be buried in the basement.
Find them.
Did you talk to Exley?
Come in out of the rain.
I want to know what happened with Exley.
Just come in.
Are you going to tell me what happened with Exley? we talked.
Tell me about him.
Later.
Now!
You fucked him.
You fucked him.
I thought I was helping you.
l´m glad you´re here.
I need you to see this.
wait....
Dudley killed Jack.
He wants you to kill me.
He showed you the photo, didn´t he?
Think!!
Goddamn you, think!!
Get out!
I checked the daily report books.
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and Stensland go way back.
I knew Stensland lied to me.
Lefferts´ mother l. D. ´d Stensland as Lefferts´ boyfriend.
Stensland pretended he didn´t know Meeks or her the night that I met...... Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks...... what the hell were they up to?
I don´t know.
But I think Stens killed Meeks over heroin. what heroin?
Johnny Stompanato told me that Meeks had heroin for sale.
Meeks ends up dead.
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.
It wasn´t the Negroes.
The rape victim lied in her statement.
The first guys to the Mercury coupe were Breuning and Carlisle.
Dudley´s guys.
They planted the shotguns.
They´d have killed the Negroes too if Jack and I hadn´t shown up.
Dudley framed them because they were Negroes and had records.
He knew there´d be no questions asked...... if they were killed resisting arrest.
Somehow this is all connected to Jack´s angle.
Sid Hudgens...... the pictures to blackmail Ellis Loew....
A kid got murdered.
To figure this out, we need to work together.
why are you doing this?
The Nite Owl made you.
You want to tear all that down?
with a wrecking ball. want to help me swing it?
Let´s go see Ellis Loew.
Find out what the District Attorney knows.
You can´t go in there.
- want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
- Ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.
These are the police.
what do you want?
I want D. A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.
I want you to get a judge to authorize wiretaps on their home phones.
I want authorization to check their bank records.
On what evidence?
Call it a hunch.
Absolutely not.
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of the department.
I won´t smear his and Patchett´s name without -- without what?
Them smearing yours first? what do they have?
Pictures of you and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?
You have any proof?
So far, you´re not denying it.
I won´t dignify this with answers.
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me...... l have a press conference for Jack Vincennes that I have to prepare for.
Unless you came to wipe my ass, I believe we´re through.
I practically invented it.
Boys, girls, ten of them get off the bus to L. A. everyday.
Pull him off me!!
I don´t know how.
I know you think you´re the A- number- one hotshot, but here´s the juice.
lf I kill you, 10 lawyers will take your place tomorrow.
Okay!
Dudley and Patchett, they....
Oh, my God!
I wouldn´t play ball so they set me up!
I gave in!
But the kid heard everything...... so they killed him. why? - what are Dudley and Patchett up to?
- Taking over Mickey Cohen´s rackets.
Because of those pictures I couldn´t prosecute them!
Oh, Jesus!
Help me up!
ls that how you ran the good cop- bad cop?
Patchett?
Looks like his bodyguard had a conflict of interest.
Suicide note.
Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out his pornography scam.
Slicing himself open wasn´t his idea.
2 of his fingers are broken.
They held him there.
Or drugged him.
Patchett´s dead.
He sent you after me.
Lynn.
west Hollywood Sheriff.
- They´re closer than we are.
- l´il get the car.
Keys!
we took her to the station for safekeeping.
Hold her as Joan Smith.
And no one sees her unless I okay it.
She wouldn´t say who.
See you, Exley.
we should talk to Lynn.
You do it. what will you do?
l´m going to talk to Sid Hudgens.
Compliment him on his performance at the Victory Motel.
Remember, Bud, we need evidence.
l´il get the evidence.
Are you okay?
You okay?
Bud hates himself for what he did.
I know how he feels.
I need to know what you can give me on Dudley Smith.
He´s a police captain in business with Patchett.
l´ve never heard of him.
Do you have a place to stay?
l´il be okay.
Nobody goes in without official l. D.!
Let him through.
Someone beat him to death, and stole a bunch of files.
Must have dug up garbage on the wrong guy. we got it narrowed down to 1000 suspects.
Sergeant white...... dispatch got a call for you.
Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet him at the Victory Motel.
You wanted to meet here?
- You called it.
I thought Hudgens was -- - Hudgens is dead.
Let´s get out of here.
lt´s too late.
You figured it was a set- up but came anyway?
A lot of bad stuff happened here.
lt´s as good a place as any for it to end.
Clip.
All I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Now´s your chance.
He died in the line of duty, didn´t he?
Goddamn it!
You okay?
Yeah.
Easy.
Move!
Rollo Tomasi.
who is he?
You are.
You´re the guy who gets away with it.
Jack knew it.
And so do l.
Are you going to shoot me...... or arrest me?
Good lad.
Always the politician.
Let me do the talking.
After l´m done, they´il make you Chief of Detectives.
Hold up your badge...... so they´il know you´re a policeman.
You think you can talk your way out of this, Lieutenant?
No...... but I can tell the truth.
During our investigation...... of events surrounding the Nite Owl case...... Jack Vincennes, Bud white and I learned the following:
Your golden boy´s throwing his whole life away.
The 3 Nite Owl suspects...... while guilty of kidnapping and rape...... were innocent of the multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.
The gunmen were most likely...... Los Angeles police officers Michael Breuning and william Carlisle...... and a third man...... who may or may not have been Captain Dudley Smith.
The objective:
The elimination of another police officer...... Richard Stensland...... who, along with former LAPD officer Leland "Buzz" Meeks...... also committed multiple homicides on behalf of Captain Smith...... and then betrayed him...... over 25 pounds of heroin...... the retrieval of which...... was the ultimate motivation behind the Nite Owl killings.
Beginning with the incarceration of Mickey Cohen...... Capt. Smith has been assuming control of organized crime in Los Angeles.
This includes the assassinations of Mickey Cohen lieutenants...... the systematic blackmail of city officials...... and the murders of Susan Lefferts, Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...... and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.
That´s it.
well...... the press will have a field day.
Christ!
lt´il stain the Department for years.
Decades.
lf we can get the kid to play ball...... who´s to say what happened?
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.
- Good idea.
- lf we get the press to play.
want to tell me what you´re smiling about?
A hero.
How´d he know what we said?
ln this situation...... you´il need more than one.
It is my pleasure to present this award to Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley...... two- time Medal of Valor recipient.
Next year the LAPD will move into its new facility. with leaders like Edmund Exley...... the image of fat cops stealing apples will be left behind...... and Los Angeles will finally have the police force it deserves.
You just couldn´t resist.
So for a while, l´m using them.
Come on.
Thanks for the push.
Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.
Some men get the world...... others get ex- hookers and a trip to Arizona.

So where are you?
You' re in some motel room.
There' s the key.
I don' t know.
This guy.
He' s here already.
Lenny!
- Like I told you before.
- Did you?
I must have forgot.
I guess I' ve already told you about my condition.
Oh, well, only every time I see you.
- My car.
- This is your car.
Oh, you' re in a playful mood.
- It' s not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.
- Hm?
- It' s broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?
Yeah, it' s just this fucked up building.
Don' t remember.
- Looks like somebody' s home.
- Ah, that thing' s been here for years.
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.
Tracks?
What are you, Pocahontas?
Come on.
Let' s take a look inside.
Teddy.
Don' t believe his lies.
He is the one.
Kill him.
I' ve finally found him.
How long have I been looking?
Find anything?
Didn' t think so.
Let' s go, huh?
Oh, fuck this.
You' re gonna pay for what you did.
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.
You don' t have a clue, you freak!
Beg my wife' s forgiveness before I blow your brains out.
Leonard, you don' t know what' s going on.
- You don' t even know my name.
- Teddy.
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.
(breathless) You don' t know who you are.
- I' m Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That' s who you were.
That' s not..... what you' ve become.
- Shut your mouth.
Come on.
Come on, let' s go down to the basement.
Let' s go down, you and me together.
Then you' il know who you really are.
- (gunshot)
It' sjust an anonymous room.
There' s nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.
(laughs) Hm.
Butjust for day- to- day stuff, notes are really useful.
Sammy Jankis had the same problem but he really had no system.
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes but he' d get them all mixed up.
You really do need a system if..... ifyou' re gonna make it work.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I' m Mr Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?
- Um...
- Burt.
I' m not sure, I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.
- You don' t know?
- I' m not too good on the phone.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.
Yeah, yeah.
- You don' t remember saying that.
- I have this condition.
- A condition?
- It' s my memory.
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it' s different from that.
I have no short- term memory.
Everything fades.
lf we talk for too long I' il forget how we started..... and next time I see you I won' t remember this conversation.
I don' t even know if I' ve met you before.
So if I seem a little strange or rude, or something, uh...
I' ve told you this before, haven' t l?
I don' t mean to mess with you but it' s so weird.
- You don' t remember me at all?
- No.
- I' m sure we have.
What' s the last thing you remember?
My wife.
What' s it like?
It' s like waking.
It' s like you just woke up.
That must suck.
It' s all backwards.
Like, maybe you got an idea about what you want to do next..... but you don' t remember what you just did.
I mean, I' m exactly the opposite...
- How long have I been staying here?
- Couple of days.
- And you' re holding my calls?
- Like you said.
OK, but this guy' s an exception.
You know this guy?
- Yeah, it' s your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?
- I saw you together, that' s all.
- He' s not my friend.
OK.
lf he calls or shows up here, give me a call in my room, OK?
- What, his name' s Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.
All right.
Look, I hope my condition' s not gonna be a problem for you.
Not as long as you remember to pay the bill.
Yeah.
OK.
This guy.
Lenny!
You really need a system ifyou' re gonna make it work.
It becomes an important part ofyour life.
Where you put them is really important.
You need ajacket that' s got, like, six pockets,..... particular pockets for particular things.
Youjust kinda learn to know where things go and how the system works.
You have to be wary of other people writing stuff foryou..... that is not going to make sense or is gonna lead you astray.
I don' t know what makes people take advantage..... of somebody with this condition.
lfyou have a piece of information which... is..... vital, writing on your body instead of on a piece ofpaper can be the answer.
(phone rings)
Who is this?
Remember Sammy Jankis.
- Thanks.
Ah, Lincoln Street?
Just go straight out on Sixth Street,...
-.. go east through town...
- I' m gonna write this down.
- Oh, it' s easy.
Go straight out...
- Trust me, I need to write this down.
The Discount lnn.
Discount lnn.
Natalie.
My car.
Teddy.
This guy told me his name was Teddy.
Don' t believe his lies.
- Yeah?
- Mr Gammell?
- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?
Lenny, it' s Teddy.
Stay there.
I' il be right over.
- (line goes dead)
White male.
First name, John.
Last name G for Gammell.
Drugs.
License plate.
SG1 3..... 7lU.
It' s him.
I' ve found you, you fuck.
You said we talked before.
I don' t remember that.
Yeah, but it' s not amnesia.
I remember up until my injury, I just can' t make new memories.
So I can' t remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.
I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.
Sammy' s story helps me understand my own situation.
Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes.
But he got mixed up.
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.
I' m disciplined and organised.
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.
Sammy had no drive,..... no reason to make it work.
Me?
Yeah,..... l got a reason.
Today, 1pm, meet Natalie for info.
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.
- Natalie.
- You don' t remember me.
I have this cond...
- You did explain, Lenny.
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.
- I know, you told me.
- Then I probably told you I hated it.
Yeah.
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
Thanks.
So, you have information for me?
- ls that what your little note says?
- Yeah.
Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list and you' il end up eating your underwear.
I guess that' s why you have those freaky tattoos.
It' s almost impossible.
Look, I' m sorry I don' t remember you.
It' s nothing personal.
I do have information for you.
You gave me a license- plate number.
Had my friend at DMV trace it.
Guess what name came up?
John Edward Gammell.
John G.
Do you know him?
No.
But his face on his driver' s licence looked really familiar.
I think he' s been in the bar, maybe.
Here' s a copy of his licence, his registration, photo and all.
Are you sure you want this?
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.
Well, then you shouldn' t have to ask.
Even if you get revenge, you' re not gonna remember it.
You' re not even gonna know it happened.
My wife deserves vengeance.
It doesn' t make any difference if I know about it.
Just because there are things I don' t remember..... doesn' t make my actions meaningless.
The world doesn' t just disappear when you close your eyes.
Get another freaky tattoo.
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her.
She was beautiful.
- To me she was perfect.
- No.
Don' t just recite the words.
Close your eyes and remember her.
You can just feel the details.
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.
And you can feel these extreme moments.
Even ifyou don' t want to.
You put these together and you get the feel of a person.
Enough to know how much you miss them.
And how much you hate the person who took them away.
I, um, I added an address in here.
It might be useful.
It' s an abandoned place outside of town.
Um, I guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.
It' s isolated.
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn' t helping you for money.
- I' m sorry.
- It' s OK.
See, you have this condition.
You still staying at the Discount lnn?
Room 304?
Left it at my place.
- They treating you OK?
- I don' t remember.
You know what we have in common?
We are both survivors.
You take care, Leonard.
Remember Sammy Jankis.
I met Sammy through work. lnsurance.
I was an investigator.
I had to see through people' s bullshit.
It was useful experience cos now it' s my life.
When I meet someone, I don' t know if I' ve met them before.
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.
Myjob taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was let them talk.
Watch the eyes and the body language.
lf someone scratches their nose, experts tell you it means they' re lying.
It really means they' re nervous.
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.
It' s all about context.
Yeah, I was good.
Sammy was my first real challenge.
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you' d split for good.
- Well, things change.
- So I see.
- My name' s Teddy.
- I guess I' ve told you about my condition.
Only every time I see ya.
Come on, I' il buy you lunch.
- Mmm.
Yeah.
I' m sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G?
You think he' s still here?
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you' re looking for.
- That' s why you haven' t left town, right?
- Maybe.
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?
You mentioned that maybe somebody was trying to set you up.
Get you to kill the wrong guy.
I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.
Lenny, you can' t trust a man' s life to your little notes and pictures.
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.
- Memory' s unreliable.
- Oh, please.
No, really.
Memory' s not perfect, it' s not even that good.
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.
The cops don' t catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff.
- They collect facts and draw conclusions.
- That' s not what I' m saying.
Facts, not memories.
I know, it' s what I used to do.
Memory can change the shape of a room, it can change the colour of a car.
And memories can be distorted.
They' re an interpretation, not a record.
They' re irrelevant if you have the facts.
You really want to get this guy, don' t you?
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.
He destroyed my ability to live.
You' re living.
Only for revenge.
Well, then we' il get the bastard.
The Discount lnn.
I don' t know what room.
I haven' t got my key.
Probably left it in your room.
Hi.
I' m checked in here but I think I' ve misplaced my key.
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?
- I don' t see my key anywhere.
This is the wrong room.
You' re in 304.
I fucked up.
- No.
Come on, let' s go.
Then why is this my handwriting?
Well,... this was your room but now you' re in 304.
- When was I in here?
- Last week.
- Then I rented you another room on top.
- Why?
Business is slow, I mean, I told my boss about your condition and stuff,..... he said rent him another room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this shit hole?
So far.
Well,..... at least you' re being honest about ripping me off.
- You' re not going to remember anyway.
- You don' t have to be that honest, Burt.
Oh, yeah.
I' il write that down.
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.
Excuse me.
Your room' s...
- Natalie.
- You don' t remember me.
I' d just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.
The guy' s a 58- year- old, semiretired accountant.
But he' s acting funny, he can' t get a handle on what' s going on.
The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.
Sammy can' t remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.
Can' t work, can' t do shit.
The medical bills pile up, his wife calls the insurance company and I get sent in.
This is my first big claims investigation so I really check into it.
Sammy can thinkjust fine but he can' t make new memories.
He can only remember things for a couple of minutes.
He' d watch TV but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing,..... he couldn' t remember how it began.
They were short.
It' s time for my shot.
The crazy part was that this guy,..... who couldn' t follow the plot of Green Acres any more,..... could do the most complicated things,..... as long as he learned them before the accident..... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.
The doctors assure me..... there' s a real condition, anterial- grade memory loss, or short- term memory loss.
It' s rare but legit.
But every time I see him,..... l catch this look,..... this... slight look of recognition.
But he says he can' t remember me at all.
I got it.
- Hi, Mr Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs Jankis.
Now, I can read people and I' m thinking "bad actor".
So now I' m suspicious and I order more tests.
Awake.
Oh, where am l?
Somebody' s bedroom.
Oh, it must be her room.
But who is she?
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah.
You?
Oh, shit.
Shit.
I gotta be someplace.
It' s useful.
You never write a phone number on your hand?
I, um, I should be able to talk to my friend today...
-.. about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.
John G' s license plate.
You have it tattooed on your thigh.
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.
lf it' s registered in this state,..... it should only take a couple seconds to pull up his licence and registration.
I' il call you as soon as I talk to him.
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I' m not too good on the phone.
You know, it' s great that you...
Well, that you' re..... helping me..... like this.
I' m helping you because you helped me.
So next time you see me,..... will you remember me?
(softly) I think you will.
(softly) I' m sorry.
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you' d split for good.
Sammy couldn' t pick up any new skills at all.
But I find something in my research.
Conditioning.
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.
It' s how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.
It' s a different part of the brain from the short- term memory.
So I had the doctors test Sammy' s response to conditioning.
- Pick up any three objects.
- That' s a test?
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?
Ta- da!
What the fuck?
- It' s a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.
Some of the objects were electrified.
They' d give him a shock.
They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified.
The point was to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects,..... not by memory, but by instinct.
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Guess I don' t have to worry about him any more.
Come inside.
- Who is he?
OK?
This is my problem.
You offered to help.
It' s nothing to do with your investigation.
How did you get me into this?
You offered to help me when you saw what he did to my face.
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- I came straight to you after he did it.
I showed you what he did and I asked you to help me.
- Yeah.
Something doesn' t feel right.
I think someone' s fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
- Did you?
- What?
Kill him?
- Course not!
Sit down, OK?
Sit.
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and I' m grateful.
You have to burn them.
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgement.
You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
- Such as?
(knocks)
I know what that' s gonna feel like when I pick it up.
See?
It' s the kind of memory you take for granted.
You know, I can remember so much.
The feel of the world...
And her.
She' s gone.
And the present is trivia which I scribble down as fucking notes.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Shhh.
Come on, take your jacket off.
(softly) Here.
Come on.
(softly) Hey.
Didn' t think you were the type.
It' s backwards.
Come here.
What about here?
Maybe it' s... for when I find him.
I' ve lost somebody too.
I' m sorry.
His name was Jimmy.
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.
He never came back.
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.
What do the police think?
They don' t look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
When you find this guy, this..... John G, what are you gonna do?
I' m gonna kill him.
Maybe I can help you find him.
I don' t even know how long she' s been gone.
It' s like I' ve woken up in bed and she' s not here..... because she' s gone to the bathroom or something.
But somehow I just...
I just know she' s never gonna come back to bed.
lf I could just..... reach over and touch her side of the bed,..... l would know that it was cold.
But I can' t.
I know I can' t have her back.
But I don' t want to wake up in the morning thinking she' s still here.
I lie here not knowing how long I' ve been alone.
So how...
How can I heal?
How am I supposed to heal if I can' t..... feel time?
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.
They kept testing Sammy for months.
Always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge.
- (buzz) - Ow!
What the fuck?
- It' s a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!
Even with total short- term memory loss,..... Sammy should have learned instinctively to stop picking up the wrong objects.
Other cases responded to conditioning, Sammy didn' t respond at all.
It suggested that his condition was psychological not physical.
We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn' t covered for mental illness.
His wife got stuck with the bills and I got a big promotion.
Conditioning didn' t work for Sammy, so he became helpless.
But it works for me.
I live the way Sammy couldn' t.
Habit and routine make my life possible.
Acting on instinct.
Awake.
Where am l?
Oh.
Some anonymous motel room.
Nothing in the drawers.
But I' il take a look anyway.
Nothing except the Gideon Bi...
Bible.
- (knock on door) - Hey!
Open up!
- (muffled cries) - Just a minute!
Open the door!
- (muffled cries) - (knocks) Lenny?
(knocking continues) Open the door!
- Hi, Teddy.
- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?
- (muffled cries) - Oh, I get it.
- Amorous neighbours.
- What are you doing here?
You said you needed my help.
You know, I' ve had more rewarding friendships than this one.
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.
What the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is that?
- You don' t know him?
Should l?
- Wait a minute. ls that John G?
- I don' t think so.
You don' t think so?
You didn' t write it down?
- For Christ sakes!
Ask him.
What' s your name?
Your name?
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?
- What?
- Who did this to you?
- I' m not going to help you kill that guy.
- No, no.
Just let me think for a minute.
OK, Natalie.
Who' s Natalie?
Natalie who?
- Why?
- Maybe I know her.
Look, we gotta get him out of here.
All right, all right, all right.
He' s got to have a car, right?
We take him to his car, tell him to get the fuck out of town or we' re gonna kill him.
We can' t walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don' t know!
Yes, I do.
This is not my room.
It must be his room.
Great.
Let' s go.
We can' t just leave him here.
- Why not?
She' il see him, call the cops.
He can lD us.
OK.
We untie him, we clean him up..... and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.
Why would I have a gun?
It must be his.
I don' t think they' d let someone like me carry a gun.
Fucking hope not.
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.
- Shut up.
- It' s all right for you, you' ve got the Jag.
All right, get in.
I' m gonna ride with him, you follow us.
Give me your keys.
Take your own car.
So was he scared?
I think it was your sinister moustache.
Should have stolen his car.
- Why?
What' s wrong with this one?
- Nothing.
You want to trade?
So what do you do now?
I' m gonna find out what the fuck that was all about.
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Sammy' s wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him.
And fighting the company' s decision.
But it wasn' t the money that got to her.
I never said that Sammy was faking.
Sammy, I have an idea.
Just that his problem was mental, not physical.
You' re gonna have a pen in your pocket.
She couldn' t understand.
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!
We' re gonna deal with it.
We' re gonna try a little harder.
She looks into his eyes and sees the same person..... and if it' s not a physical problem, he should snap out of it.
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called.
Ellen called.
Ellen...
Ellen can' t come today!
- Ellen can' t come!
- I' m so sorry!
I' m sorry!
- (sobs)
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt.
Just like he gave it to the doctors.
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.
Hm.
I don' t feel drunk.
- Hello?
- Oh, shit!
- Not right now!
- Oh, I' m sorry.
Dodd.
Put him onto Teddy orjust get rid of him for Natalie.
Dodd.
Get rid of him.
Ask Natalie.
(dialling tone)
Yeah, leave your number, you know what to do.
- (beep) - Yeah.
This is a message for Teddy.
I' m at the Mount Crest lnn on Fifth Street, room six.
I need you to come over as soon as you get this.
It' s important.
Bye.
Fuck!
Mrs Jankis didn' t understand that you can' t bully someone into remembering.
Ah.
Well, then, call me back?
Oh, I' m chasing this guy.
No.
He' s chasing me.
Ah!
Fuck!
Dodd, white guy, Mount Crest lnn on Fifth Street.
I' il get thejump on you, you fucker.
Oh, fuck!
Sorry.
I need a weapon.
This' il do.
Hm.
I don' t feel drunk.
Do I know this guy?
- (car horn) - He seems to know me.
- (tyres squeal)
- I like your car.
- Thank you.
- Where' d you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?
What, I haven' t made a strong enough impression on you?
- (taps on window)
So what am I doing?
Who is this?
Ouch!
Cut it out.
- How can you read that again?
- It' s good.
- You' ve read it, like, a thousand times.
- I enjoy it.
I thought the pleasure of a book was in wanting to know what happens next.
Don' t be a prick.
I' m not reading it to annoy you.
I enjoy it.
Just let me read.
Please?
Probably tried this before.
Probably burned truckloads ofyour stuff.
Can' t remember to forget you.
Uh- huh.
Well, sir, that' d certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.
Will you hang on a sec?
The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.
With my condition it' s really tough.
I can' t keep it all in mind at once.
I have to summarise the sections.
There are pages missing.
I guess I' ve been trying to log them all.
I don' t know why these are crossed out.
They weren' t even looking for John G.
(door slams)
Honey, it' s late.
(muffled cry)
- (muffled gasp) - You OK in there?
(laughs softly)
What?
Was I supposed to lock the door?
(softly) No.
I' d like you to leave now.
There' s something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn' t ring true.
It' s bullshit.
He' s not gonna go breaking into places while he' s still got a stash that big.
Or planted it there.
Oh, shit, that' s true.
It fits.
So he' s a dealer.
Hang on a sec.
Now we' re getting somewhere.
Discount lnn.
Yeah, OK.
Blonde' s fine.
Well, that' s what they say.
304.
Leonard.
Well, what then?
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.
You go into the bathroom and slam the door.
- Yeah.
Loud enough to wake me up.
- That' s it.
Ah...
Yeah, first I just need you to put these things around the room.
Pretend they' re your things and this is your bedroom.
- Should I wear it?
Uh, just like you took it off.
I' m sorry.
I just mean put them around the room, as if they were your... your things.
Whatever gets you off.
I can' t blame the cops for not taking me seriously.
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn' t deal with it.
I told you how she tried to get him to snap out of it.
I found out all kinds of shit.
How she treated him.
She' d get Sammy to hide food around the house,..... then she' d stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember.
She wasn' t a cruel person.
Shejust wanted her old Sammy back.
You know all about Sammy and you' ve decided he' s faking.
The company' s position isn' t that Sammy' s faking anything,..... just that his condition can' t be shown to be...
I just want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
We shouldn' t be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.
- I' m not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?
Try to understand, when I look at Sammy, I don' t see some... vegetable.
I see my same old Sammy.
What do you think that' s like for me,..... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?
That if I just could say the right thing,..... he' d snap out of it and go back to being normal.
lf I...
lf I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone,..... then I could say goodbye and start loving this new Sammy.
As long as I have doubt I can' t say goodbye and move on.
What do you want from me?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds..... and tell me if you really believe that Sammy' s faking his condition.
I need to know..... what you honestly believe.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Thank you.
I thought I' d helped her.
I didn' t think it was important what it was.
Just that she had one to believe.
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?
What, your sense of humour went with the memory?
Do you know why you' re here?
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny,..... let me inform you, your business here is very much finished.
- You' re still here because of Natalie.
- Who' s Natalie?
Schmuck!
Whose house do you think you just walked out of?
That' s right, take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz (!)
You' il want to make a note.
You can' t trust her.
Why' s that?
Because by now she' s taken a look at the suit and the car..... and she' s figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.
She' s already got you staying with her, for Christ sakes.
You can' t go back there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.
You' re lucky I ran into you.
That broad' s bad news.
- What do you mean, "bad news"?
- She' s involved with drugs.
Look.
See these?
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend' s a drug dealer.
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.
He writes messages on the back of these,..... then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up,..... she' s gonna use you to protect herself.
From who?
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody' s got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she' il make it you.
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she' il make it you. ls that it?
You worried that she' s gonna use me against you?
- No.
- Why not?
Because she doesn' t know who I am.
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.
She doesn' t know anything about your investigation.
OK, Einstein?
So write this down.
When she offers to help, it' il be for her own reasons.
I' m not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.
Do not trust her.
There.
You happy now?
- I won' t be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?
You ever wonder how long you can hang around here...
-.. before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?
The same questions you should be asking yourself.
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?
- I have money.
- From what?
I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
You don' t have a clue, do you?
You don' t even know who you are.
Yes, I do.
I don' t have amnesia.
I remember everything right up until the incident.
I am Leonard Shelby, I am from San Francisco...
That' s who you were.
You do not know who you are.
What you' ve become since..... the incident.
You wander around playing detective.
You don' t even know how long ago it was.
Let me put it this way.
Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?
- I didn' t sell insurance, I investigated it.
- Right, right.
You' re an investigator.
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.
Look, do me a favour, don' t go back in there.
Will you take the motel out of town?
It' s been fun, Lenny.
Do not trust her.
Don' t believe his lies.
I need my own place.
(starts engine)
No.
She shouldn' t have given me that responsibility.
I' m a claims investigator, not a doctor.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I' ve got all sorts of other considerations.
Legal responsibility, large financ...
- (line goes dead)
Write this down.
Write down what happened.
Write it down.
Keep it in mind.
Find a p...
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.
Who?
Who?
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Why?
Because of you!
Because I did what you told me to do, reason with him,...
Great idea!
- Calm down.
Calm down, take it easy.
You' re safe.
Come on.
Just sit down.
Sit down.
Here, sit down.
You' re OK.
I' il just get some ice for your face.
Here.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
I went to Dodd..... and I told him that I didn' t have any of Jimmy' s money,..... or the drugs.
And that this Teddy must have taken everything.
And what did he say?
He didn' t believe me.
He said if I don' t have the drugs by tomorrow, he' s gonna kill me.
And then he just... he just started hitting me.
Where is he?
- Why?
- I' il go see him.
I' il give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Oh, he' il kill you, Lenny.
- Yeah?
Yeah, I hated it.
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let' s just think of something else, OK?
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.
And where I can find him.
Have you got a pen?
ln my purse.
He' il, um,... he' il probably find you.
What do you mean?
I told him about your car.
Why?
He was beating the shit out of me, I had to tell him something.
Just write it all down.
Be careful.
I' il be fine.
- Who the fuck are you?
Front desk?
Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21.
Yeah, that' s it, I don' t want any calls.
No, none at all.
- What' s wrong?
- Somebody' s come already.
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money.
He thinks I took it.
Did you?
- What' s this all about?
- You don' t have a fucking clue, do you?
You' re just blissfully ignorant, aren' t you?
- Look, I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition!
I probably know more about it than you, you don' t have a clue about anything else.
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.
He took a lot of money with him and never came back.
Jimmy' s partners think I set him up.
I don' t know if you know this Teddy.
- Neither do l.
- Don' t protect him!
Help me.
- How?
- Get rid of Dodd for me.
- What?
- Kill him.
I' il pay you.
What do you think I am?
I' m not gonna kill someone for money.
What, then?
Love?
What would you kill for?
- You' d kill for your wife, wouldn' t you?
- That' s different.
- Not to me, I wasn' t married to her!
- Hey, don' t talk about my wife.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!
I can say whatever I want and you won' t remember!
I can call your wife a fucking whore and we can still be friends.
- Calm down.
- You can' t get scared!
You don' t know how, you fucking idiot!
This has nothing to do with me.
How the fuck would you know?
You don' t know a fucking thing!
- Hey, can you get angry?
- Yes.
You pathetic piece of shit!
I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won' t have a clue, you fucking retard!
I' m gonna use you.
I' m telling you now because I' m gonna enjoy it much more..... if I know that you could stop me if you weren' t such a fucking freak.
Did you lose your pen?
Too bad, freak.
Otherwise you could write yourself a note about how much Natalie hates your guts..... and that I called your wife a whore!
- About your whore of a wife?
I read about your condition, Leonard.
You know one of the causes of short- term memory loss?
Venereal disease.
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife..... sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard!
(softly) You sad, sad freak.
I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won' t remember.
We' il still be best friends.
Fuck!
I' il see you soon.
- (door opens and closes) - Stay focused.
Find a pen.
I' m gonna write it down.
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.
Keep it in mind, keep it in mind, keep it in mind.
I' ve got to find a pen.
I' ve got to find a pen.
Now, write this down, write this down.
Exactly what happened.
I' m gonna write down what happened.
Come on, come on!
I' ve got to find a pen!
Jeez!
Come on, keep focused.
Keep focused.
Keep...
Keep it in mind.
Come on, find a pen.
Write this note.
Write down what happened.
Write it down.
Find a p...
What happened?
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.
- Who?
- Who?
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
- (knock at door) - Hello?
Yeah?
I know you said you didn' t want any calls but this guy on the phone says he' s a cop.
- Yeah.
He says you' re really gonna wanna know what he has to say.
I' m not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye.
Well, what...
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.
It' s comfortable.
Just have a seat.
Thanks.
Hm?
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife.
Oh, it depends on if he' s here in town or if he' s moved on.
I have my file here.
Can I ask you something?
lf you have all that information, why haven' t the police found him for you?
- They' re not looking for him.
- Why not?
They don' t think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.
Her side of the bed was cold.
She' d obviously been gone for a while.
There had to be a second man.
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.
It' s the last thing I do remember.
Look, the police didn' t believe me.
lf we check...
How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff?
John G was clever.
He was clever.
He took the dead man' s gun and replaced it with the sap he hit me with.
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.
They found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man' s hand.
And they only found my gun.
They didn' t need to look for anybody else.
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts and I had brain damage.
Leonard.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it will help you.
Oh, thanks.
I have to go back to work, so, um, just make yourself at home.
You can watch TV or have some food.
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.
One thing.
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.
Natalie.
- Somebody' s come already.
(phone rings)
- Thanks.
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.
- Hm?
- Your condition.
Well, nobody' s perfect.
What' s the last thing that you do remember?
- My wife.
- That' s sweet.
Dying.
I remember my wife dying.
Let me, um, get you another one.
I think this one' s dusty.
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?
I know you' re a cop.
What do you want?
Have I done something wrong?
Look, why are you asking me?
I can' t remember what I' ve done.
You wouldn' t believe me anyway.
Because of my condition, you don' t believe someone with this condition.
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn' t even fucking believe Sammy!
Come by after.
Natalie.
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?
A beer, please.
You can' t just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?
- I' m meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that' s me.
- Then why am I here?
- I don' t know, why don' t you tell me?
I don' t remember.
I have no short- term memory.
Oh, you' re that memory guy.
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.
- Oh, yeah?
Who' s your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants.
Do you know him?
No.
He knows you.
He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.
ln fact, a cop came by earlier and was looking for you.
Said he was looking for a guy who can' t remember anything,..... wouldn' t know how he' d got here or what he' d done.
I get a lot of guys round here like that.
Chronic alcoholism is one cause of short- term memory loss.
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name' s Leonard.
- I don' t know.
What' s happened to Jimmy?
- I don' t know that, either.
- You don' t remember anything?
You don' t remember where you' ve been or what you' ve just done?
I can' t make new memories.
Everything just fades.
- I found this in my pocket.
Your pocket?
Bar bet.
Care to contribute?
- No, thanks.
- It' s for a lot of money.
Come on.
Help me out.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
(man laughs)
It' s completely fucked because nobody believes you.
It' s amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.
I guess it' s poetic justice for not believing Sammy.
You know the truth about my condition, officer?
You don' t know anything.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.
Like Sammy.
What if I' d done something like Sammy?
I didn' t tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?
She came to see me at my office.
I didn' t tell her what I really thought but I never said that he was faking.
Just that his condition was mental, not physical.
Sammy?
It' s time for my shot.
She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her, so she found a way to test him.
Sammy?
It' s time for my shot.
- There you go.
Or shejust didn' t want to live with the things she' d put him through.
It' s time for my shot.
It won' t hurt.
She went into a coma and never recovered.
Oh!
He doesn' t even know his wife is dead.
I was wrong about Sammy and I was wrong about his wife.
She wasn' t interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.
His brain didn' t respond to conditioning but he wasn' t a con man.
And when she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.
When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.
Now I know you fake it.
lf you think you' re supposed to recognise somebody, you pretend to.
You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.
(tyres squeal)
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It' s private back here.
Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?
The Jag' s out front.
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There' s plenty of tattoo parlours up north.
I guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.
- Give me the keys, I' il move it.
- It' il be all right.
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ...
Give me a minute, I' ve got to get something for you.
Fact six.
Car licence SG13 7lU.
Look, wait a minute, will ya?
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?
Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?
- It' s not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?
Because that cop' s looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity,..... some new clothes, a different car would do for now.
Put these on.
What cop?
He' s a bad cop.
He' s the one that checked you into the Discount lnn.
He' s been calling you for days, slipping envelopes under your door, shit like that.
- How do you know this?
- He told me.
He' s been laughing at you.
- You' re full of shit.
- No, I' m not.
He knows you' re no good on the phone so he' s been calling you up.
Jimmy Grants.
- Who' s Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard, Jimmy' s the drug dealer.
The cop wants to know how his operation is run.
He' s got some score in mind.
- Somehow you' re involved.
- How do you know him?
I' m a snitch.
He' s a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.
lf he knew I was helping you, he' d fucking kill me.
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Leonard, just go.
Come by after.
Natalie.
Ferdy' s bar.
Hey, Jimmy.
I' m sorry, I, uh, thought you were somebody else.
Sorry.
That' s OK.
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?
But he' s not going to bring her along?
He' il come by himself, right?
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.
No, officer.
I' m as ready as I' il ever be.
You' re in the lobby?
I' il be right there.
Officer Gammell?
Yeah.
Come on.
- Hey, smile.
Not here.
Over here.
ls it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
Don' t write Gammell, just Teddy.
- Why?
- I' m undercover.
This is the directions, where he' s going.
- My number' s on the bottom if you...
- You' re not coming?
Nah, it wouldn' t be appropriate.
Nice picture.
I look thin.
Make him beg.
Hey, Teddy!
Teddy!
Jimmy.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?
Expecting any other Jimmys, memory man?
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.
Well?
Motherfuck!
Strip.
- Strip!
My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.
Don' t say anything else.
- Take it off.
Your pants, too.
- Why?
- I don' t wanna get blood on them.
Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what I was bringing?
- Take your fuckin 'pants off!
- I' ve got two hundred grand in the car!
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?
- Just take the money and walk away.
- I don' t want your fucking money.
Then, what?
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fucking life back!
(softly) Sammy.
He said Sammy.
How does he know about Sammy?
Oh, fuck.
Hey, mister!
I need help!
There' s a guy in here, he' s hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.
I don' t know what happened.
I' ve got this memory thing.
- Do I know you?
Don' t worry, I' m a cop.
- ls he still breathing?
- Well, I don' t know.
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- I don' t remember, I have this condition.
- Ow!
Lenny!
That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?
- You are a fucking cop!
- And I' m the guy that helped you find him.
Get up!
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!
Who is that?
He knew me.
Of course he did, he raped your wife, he fucked up your brain.
Bullshit!
He' s not the guy.
His name is James F Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.
- What?
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines I told him I had.
- No.
Yeah, that and your thing.
I figured we' d make a few dollars on the side.
- How did he know me?
- The Discount lnn.
He dealt out of there.
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came round.
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture.
- You' re fucking using me.
You get half.
He knew about Sammy, why would I tell him about Sammy?!
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who' il listen!
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.
There' s nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.
Who cares if there' s a few little details you' d rather not remember?
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don' t know.
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.
The insulin.
That' s Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.
Condtitioning yourself to remember, learning through repetition.
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.
Sammy was a con man.
A faker.
I never said that Sammy was faking.
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.
I was wrong.
That' s the whole point.
- See, Sammy' s wife came to me...
- Sammy didn' t have a wife.
It was your wife who had diabetes.
Ouch!
My wife wasn' t diabetic.
You sure?
Ouch!
Cut it out!
She wasn' t diabetic.
You think I don' t know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I guess I can only make you remember the things you want to be true.
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He' s not the right guy.
He was to you.
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?
- It makes all the difference.
You' re never gonna know.
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won' t.
- Somehow I' il know.
- You won' t remember!
When it' s done, I will know.
I thought so, too, I was sure of it, but you didn' t!
That' s right.
The real John G. I helped you find him over a year ago.
- He' s already dead.
- Don' t lie to me any more.
Look, Lenny,..... l was the cop assigned to your wife' s case, I believed you.
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.
I' m the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night.
The guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.
We found him, you killed him.
But you didn' t remember.
So I helped you start looking again, looking for the guy you already killed.
- Oh, yeah?
So who was he?
- Just some guy.
Does it matter who?
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy, just bad fucking luck.
Couple of junkies too strung out to realise your wife didn' t live alone.
But when you killed him I was so convinced that you' d remember.
But it didn' t stick.
Like nothing ever sticks, like this won' t stick.
I took that picture.
Just when you did it.
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.
- Oh, gee, thanks (!)
- Fuck you.
I gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help.
You don' t want the truth.
You make up your own truth, like your police file.
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?
You, probably.
- No, it wasn' t me, see, it was you.
- Why would I do that?
To create a puzzle you could never solve.
Do you know how many towns,..... how many John Gs or James Gs?
I mean, shit, Lenny, I' m a fucking John G.
- Your name' s Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.
My name' s John Edward Gammell.
Cheer up.
There' s plenty of John Gs for us to find.
All you do is moan!
I' m the one that has to live with what you' ve done.
I' m the one that put it all together.
You, you wander around, you' re playing detective.
You' re living a dream, kid.
A dead wife to pine for, a sense of purpose to your life,..... a romantic quest that you wouldn' t end even if I wasn' t in the picture.
- I should kill you.
Lenny, come on.
You' re not a killer.
That' s why you' re so good at it.
Come on, what are you doing?
You know what time it is?
It' s beer o' clock, I' m buying.
Fuck!
I' m not a killer.
I' mjust someone who wanted to make things right.
Can ljust let myself forget what you' ve told me?
Can ljust let myself forget what you made me do?
You think ljust want another puzzle to solve?
Another John G to look for?
You' re a John G.
So you can be my John G.
Do I lie to myself to be happy?
ln your case, Teddy,..... yes, I will.
Hey!
Hey, that' s not your car!
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can' t take it!
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!
Somebody' il recognise it.
You know, I think I' d rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.
I might hang on to this for a while.
Lenny.
Will you help me find the keys?
Help me find my keys!
Lenny!
Lenny!
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning.
Even if I can' t remember them.
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world' s still here.
Do I believe the world' s still here?
Yeah.
We all need memories to remind ourselves who we are.
(tyres screech)
Now, where was l?
Flight 784 for San Francisco is now ready forboarding at --
ln mate number 87645 -- Cole, James.
- Jose, what' s going on?
- Volunteers?
And they said your name.
Maybe they' il give you a pardon, man.
Yeah.
That' s why none ofthe volunteers come back.
Some come back, I heard.
Please put me back!
Don' t take me!
They got 'em up on the seventh foor.
They hide 'em up there.
They' re all messed up in the head.
You don' t know they' re all messed up.
Nobody' s seen 'em.
And maybe they' re not messed up.
That' s a rumour.
Nobody knows that.
I don' t believe that.
Good luck, man.
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn' t volunteer.

No, no trouble.

I don' t think he' s gonna hurt us.
You aren' t gonna hurt us, are you, Mr Cole?
No, sir.
Why don' t you sit down, Mr Cole?
We appreciate your volunteering.
You' re a very good observer.
- Thankyou.
- We have a very advanced programme.
- A chance to reduce your sentence.
And possibly play an important role... in returning the human race to the surface ofthe Earth.
Strong mentally.
We' ve had some misfortunes with unstable types.
For a man in your position, an opportunity.
Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.
lurking in some vague electricity.
But ifwe but listen... we hear the solitary voice ofthat poet telling us... yesterday this day' s madness did prepare... tomorrow' s silent triumph ofdespair.
Drink, foryou know not whence you came, nor why.
Drink, foryou know not why you go, nor where. "
Wandering around in nothing but his underpants... and one ofthose plastic, see- through lady' s raincoats.
So, they get there, they ask the guy real nice for some kind of lD.
He gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
Totally irrational, totally disoriented.
Doesn' t know where he is, what day ofthe week it is.
All they got was his name.
They figured he' s stoned out of his mind.
Some kind of psychotic episode.
- He' s been tested for drugs?
But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.
You believe that?
- He' s in restraints.
Yeah.
Weren' t you listenin '?
I' ve got two police officers in the hospital!
The medic gave him enough Stelazine to kill a horse.
He' s rarin 'to go.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
The struggle.
You wanna go in there, examine him?
Yes, please.
ls this all you have?
Ran it through your system?
Nothing.
- I should probably go in with you.
- That won' t be necessary.
- All right.
He' il be right here, just in case.
Mr Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I' m a psychiatrist.
I don' t work for the police.
So my concern is foryour well- being.
Do you understand that?
Need to go!
Need to go!
I can' t make the police let you go.
But I do wanna help you, so l --
I need you to tell me exactly what happened tonight.
Do you think you can do that, James?
May I call youJames?
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.
- Have you been a patient at County?
- Have I seen you someplace?
I need to go!
I' m supposed to be gathering information.
- What kind of information?
Won' t help anyone.
Won' t change anything.
James, do you know why you' re here?
'Cause I' m a good observer.
I' ve got a tough mind.
You don' t remember assaulting a police officer?
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?
You' ve been in an institution before, haven' t you?
- Or hospital?
- No!
Now I need to go.
Need to go!
- Have you been in prison, James?
- Underground.
Hiding?
I love this air.
Oh, it' s such wonderful air.
- What' s wonderful about the air, James?
- Very fresh.
Why do you think there aren' t any germs in the air?
- This is October, right?
- April.
- What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?
1 996.
That' s the future, James.
Do you thinkyou' re living in the future?
1 996 is the past.
No, 1 996 is the future.
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where' re you taking me?
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel.
You' il love it.
I can' t go to France.
Yeah, yeah.
Zip it, Daisy.
You fooled the shrink, but you don' t fool us.
Let' s go, ace.
Come on, come on.
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head, Jimbo.
- See ifyou got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.
Got to get to a doctor, Jimbo.
Can' t make no calls till the doctor says.
It' s very important!
What you gotta do, Jimbo, is take it easy.
Relax into things.
And we' il all get along fine ifyou just relax.
Let' s go.
Come on, let' s go.
Hey, Goines!
Yo, Goines!
Yo, Jeffrey!
- What?
- Look here.
This here' sJames.
Now, do me a favour.
Why don' t you show him around?
Show him the games and stuff.
How much you gonna pay me?
How much?
- Five thousand dollars.
That enough?
- Five thousand?
I' il wire a cheque to your account as usual.
I' il give him the deluxe mental hospital tour.
Kid around, makes' em feel good.
You' re the prisoners.
No, you' re the guards.
Now you got it.
Okay, it' s all in good fun.
Here' s some games here.
Get out!
He was in my chair.
Games.
Games.
Here' s some games.
Games that wanna get out.
See?
More games.
Games, they vegetize you.
lfyou play the games, you' re voluntarily taking a tranquillizer.
I guess they gave you some chemical restraints.
What' d they give you?
Thorazine?
Haldol?
How much?
Know your dosages.
It' s elementary.
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?
That' s communication with the outside world.
Doctor' s discretion.
lfall ofthese nuts could just make phone calls... it could spread insanity oozing through telephone cables... oozing to the ears ofall these poor, sane people, infecting them.
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.
ln fact, very few, Jim -- Jim, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.
I' m not saying you' re not mentally ill.
But that' s not why you' re here.
You' re here because ofthe system.
There' s the television.
It' s all right there.
All right there.
Look, listen, kneel, pray.
The commercials!
It' s all automated.
What are we for then?
We' re consumers, Jim.
Okay, okay.
Buy a lot ofstuff, you' re a good citizen.
But ifyou don' t buy a lot ofstuff, what are you then?
What?
You' re mentally ill.
Fact, Jim.
Fact! lfyou don' t buy things: toilet paper, new cars... electrically operated sexual devices... stereo systems with brain- implanted headphones... screwdrivers with built- in radar devices, voice- activated computers --
Take it easy, Jeffrey.
Be calm!
Right.
That' s right.
You' re a very attractive woman.
lfyou want to watch a particular TV programme, like AllMy Children... go to the nurse, tell her the day, the time the show you wanna see is on.
But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on.
This guy was always requesting shows that had already played.
Yes.
You have to tell her before.
He couldn' t grasp the idea that the nurse couldn' t make it be yesterday.
She couldn' t turn back time!
Thankyou, Einstein.
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake, Jim.
Okay, that' s it, Jeffrey.
You' re gonna get a shot.
- I warned you.
- Right.
I got a little carried away... explaining the inner workings ofthe institution toJim.
I don' t really come from outer space.
Oh.
L. J. Washington.
He doesn' t really come from outer space.
Don' t mock me, my friend.
Get outta my chair!
It' s a condition of mental divergence.
I find myself on the planet Ogo.
Part ofan intellectual elite... preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on Pluto.
But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in all ways... nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche.
I am mentally divergent... in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities... that plague my life here.
When I stop going there, I will be well.
Are you also divergent, friend?
This is a place for crazy people.
I' m not crazy.
We don' t use that term, "crazy," Mr Cole.
You' ve got some real nuts here!
I know some things that you don' t know.
It' s gonna be very difficult foryou to understand it.
I' m not gonna hurt anyone!
All right.
Look, have any ofyou heard... ofthe Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys?
They stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere.
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?
Why don' t you just take your time... and try to explain this from the beginning?
Right, right.
It' s 1 990.
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn' t have been active yet.
Five billion people died in 1 996 and 1 997.
Almost the entire population ofthe world.
Only about one percent of us survived.
- How can l?
This already happened.
I can' t save you.
I am simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present... trace the path ofthe virus.
We' re not in the present now, Mr Cole?
1 990 is the past.
This already happened.
That' s what I' m trying --
No!
1 996 is the past too.
Listen to me.
What l --
What l -- What I need to do is make a telephone call.
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?
The scientists.
They' il want to know that they sent me to the wrong time.
I can leave a voice mail message that they monitor from the present.
Can I just make one telephone call, please?
Please?
What are you doin 'in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!
Who put those Doritos in there anyway?
What?
Voice mail?
I don' t know what you' re talkin 'about.
ls this a joke?
I don' t know any scientists.
Duanne, get out -- James who?
Wasn' t who you expected?
It was some lady.
She didn' t know anything.
Well, maybe it was the wrong number.
No.
I remember things.
James, where did you grow up?
Dr Railly.
I have the strangest feeling I' ve met you before.
This is 1 990.
I' m supposed to be leaving messages in 1 996!
It' s not the right numberyet!
That' s the problem!
Won' t work.
See?
Told you.
All the doors are locked too.
They' re protecting the people on the outside from us... when the people on the outside are as crazy as us.
Do you know what "crazy" is?
Crazy is "majority rules." Yeah.
Take germs, for example.
Germs?
ln the 1 8th century, no such thing.
Nothing.
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person, anyway.
Along comes this doctor.
Semmelweis!
Semmelweis comes along, trying to convince people, other doctors mainly... that there are these teeny, tiny, invisible bad things called germs... that get into your body and make you sick.
He' s trying to get doctors to wash their hands.
What is this guy?
Crazy?
Teeny, tiny, invisible -- "What do you call 'em?
What? "
Now, cut to the 20th century.
I go in to order a burger in this fast- food joint.
The guy drops it on the foor.
Jim, he picks it up, wipes it off.
He hands it to me like it was all okay.
"What about the germs?" I say.
He says, "I don' t believe in germs.
Germs are a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soaps. "
Now, he' s crazy, right?
There' s no wrong.
There' s only popular opinion.
You, you, you believe in germs, right?
I' m not crazy.
Ofcourse not!
You wanna escape, right?
That' s very sane.
I can help you.
You want me to, don' t ya?
Get you out?
You know how to get outta here?
- Then why don' t ya?
- Why don' t I try to escape?
Very good question.
lntelligent.
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?
I' ve managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits... secretaries ofsecretaries and other assorted minions... who will contact my father.
And when my father finds out I' m in this kind of place... he' il have them transfer me to one ofthose classyjoints... where they treat you properly, like a person, a guest!
With sheets and towels like a big hotel... with great drugs for all of us nut- case, lunatic, maniac devils!
Sorry.
Sorry.
I got a little agitated.
The thought ofescape crossed my mind.
And suddenly --
Suddenly I felt like bending the fucking bars back!
And ripping out the window frames and eating them!
And leaping, leaping, leaping!
Colonics for everyone!
I' m a mental patient.
I' m supposed to act out.
My father' s gonna be really upset.
And when my father gets upset, the ground shakes.
My father is God!
I worship my father!
These dramatic video tapes, secretly obtainedbyanimalrightsactivists... have arousedpublic indignation.
But manyscientists vehemently disagree.
Torture experiments.
- We' re all monkeys.
- They hurt you?
Not as bad as what they' re doing to the Easter Bunny.
Look at them.
They' rejust askin 'for it.
Maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out.
Wiping out the human race?
It' s a great idea.
It' s great.
But more ofa long- term thing.
First we have to focus on more immediate goals.
I didn' t say a word about you- know- what.
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan.
Emancipation.
What are you writing?
You a reporter?
It' s private.
A lawsuit?
You gonna sue 'em?
Time foryour meds.
Take a chance.
Live the moment.
Sunshine.
Gorgeousbeaches.
The Florida Keys!
We' ilreturnyou to the MarxBrothers in Monkey Business.
Monkey business!
Fetch!
Monkey.
Monk key.
What?
lfyousee a bearish future in the decade ahead... considerthe changessweeping the world andthe opportunities theyoffer.
"And the opportunities they offer." Ooh!
They really dosed you.
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.
Remember the plan.
What?
Not "what." When.
- Yes.
When.
Now, Jim.
Yes!
Now!
Sell!
Stocks!
Bonds!
Purchase!
Sell!
No more monkey business!
No... more... monkey business!
Yes, enhance your portfolio now.
Five hundred dollars.
I' m insured!
Yeah!
A window ofopportunity is opening now.
Now is the time for all good men to seize the moment.
The moment!
Now is the time for all good men to seize the day!
Goddam it, Jeffrey!
Quit playin 'the fool!
MasterCard!
Visa!
The key to happiness!
Jim, seize the moment!
Jeffrey, come back here!
- Get out.
Out!
- Come here, Jeffrey!
Last chance!
Last chance!
Best place to go would be Florida.
The Keys are lovely this time ofyear.
Two' s not working today.
Kathryn, this was in my box!
But I have a slight suspicion it wasn' t meant for me.
"You are the most bootiful woman I have ever seen.
You live in a bootiful world, but you don' t know it.
You have freedom, sunshine, airyou can breathe -- "
James Cole, right?
"I would do anything to stay here but I must leave.
Please help me. "
Poor man.
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one ofyours, right?
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.
Shit!
We have to know exactly what' s there so we can fix it.
Doctor, we have a visitor.
May I help you?
Excuse me?
Hey, Jimbo.
What' s up, man?
- It' il be all right.
Take it easy.
We' il work this out, okay?
A little milk and cookies, you' il be all right.
Just take it easy, okay?
Calm down!
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!
I' m not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr Railly, help me, please.
- No!
No more drugs!
You' re very confused.
Kathryn, we' ve been working together for fouryears.
I' ve never seen you like this before.
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn' t an inquisition.
I didn' t think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactly what --
He should' ve been in restraints.
It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.
Why not own up to it?
Okay, it was bad judgment.
But I have the strangest feeling about him.
- I' ve seen him before and I' m trying -- - Two policemen are in the hospital.
Now we' ve got a security guard with a skull fracture.
I said it was bad judgment!
What else do you want me to say?
You see that?
See what I mean?
You' re being defensive.
lsn' t she being defensive?
We have another situation.
- Yes, sir.
I did it myself.
And he was fully sedated?
He was fully sedated.
Are you trying to tell me a fully sedated, fully restrained patient... somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him... and is wriggling his way through the ventilation system?
Watch it!
You sure fucked up!
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!
My name' s not Bob.
Not a prob, Bob.
Where' d they send you?
- Where are you?
- Another cell.
Maybe.
What' s that supposed to mean?
Maybe means... maybe I' m in the next cell.
Another volunteer like you.
Or maybe I' m in the Central Office... spying on ya for all those science bozos.
Or, hey... maybe I' m not even here.
Maybe I' m just in your head.
No way to confirm anything.
- Where' d they send ya?
'90!
How was it?
Good drugs?
Lots of pussy?
Hey, Bob, you do thejob?
You find out the big info?
Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys?
It was supposed to be 1 996.
Science ain' t an exact science with these clowns.
You' re lucky you didn' t end up in ancient Egypt.
Shh!
They' re comin '.
The Freedom forAnimalsAssociation on SecondAvenue... is thesecret headquarters oftheArmyofthe Twelve Monkeys.
Theyare the ones who aregoing to do it.
lhave togo now.
Have a merry Christmas.
- Well?
- What?
Did you or did you not record that message?
It' s a reconstruction ofa deteriorated recording.
Weak signal.
We have to put them together one word at a time.
Wejust finished rebuilding this.
Did you or did you not make this call?
I couldn' t make any call.
You sent me to the wrong year.
It was 1 990.
- You' re certain ofthat?
- What' d you do with your time, Cole?
Women?
- They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?
Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I was in trouble.
I got arrested.
I did what you wanted.
I got a specimen, a spider.
I didn' t have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.
But you sent me to the wrong year, so it really doesn' t matter.
Did you see this when you went back?
No, sir, I don' t think so.
What about these people?
Did you see any ofthese people?
No.
Oh, wait, wait.
You saw that man?
Maybe in the mental institution.
You were in a mental institution?
Oh, God.
Cole, you were sent back to make some very important observations.
You could' ve made a real contribution.
Helped us to reclaim the planet.
As well as reducing your sentence.
The question is, Cole, do you want another chance?
Last connection going on.
No mistakes this time, Cole.
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.
We' re thinking about the spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.
Don' t fight it.
Right on the money.
I don' t understand!
I don' t understand!
- Where am l?
- I gotta find 'em!
I gotta find 'em!
Help me!
I don' t know where I am.
- You gotta help me find 'em!
- Jose!
- Cole!
Cole, where are we?
- Help me, Cole!
- Oh, God, wait!
"ln a season ofgreatpestilence... there are omensanddivinations.
And one ofthe four beasts gave unto the seven angels... seven golden vials full ofthe wrath of God... who liveth forever and ever. "
Revelations.
ln the 1 4th century, according to accounts ofofficials ofthat time... this man appeared suddenly in the village ofWyle near Stonehenge... in April of 1 362.
Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent... the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence... which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years.
Obviously this plague- doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling... when reality supports it with a virulent disease... whether it' s the bubonic plague, small pox or AlDS.
Now we have technological horrors as well... such as chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head... during the deadly mustard gas attacks ofWorld War l.
During such an attack in the French trenches in October of 1 91 7... we have an account ofthis soldier... who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel... and hospitalized, apparently in a state of hysteria.
Doctors found he had lost all comprehension of French... but that he spoke English fuently... albeit in a regional dialect they didn' t recognize.
The man, though physically unaffected by the gas... was beside himself.
He claimed that he had come from the future... that he was looking for a pure germ... that would ultimately wipe mankind offthe face ofthe Earth... starting in the year 1 996.
Though injured, the young soldier disappeared from the hospital... no doubt trying to carry on his mission to warn others... and substituting for the agony ofwar... a self- inficted agony we call "the Cassandra complex."
Cassandra, in Greek legend, was condemned to know the future... but to be disbelieved when she foretold it.
Hence, the agony offoreknowledge, plus the impotence to do anything about it.
I' m going right out to get vaccinated.
I think, Dr Railly, you' ve given alarmists a bad name.
I have?
- This is true.
- Proliferation ofatomic devices.
Uncontrolled breeding habits.
Pollution of land, sea and air.
The rape ofthe environment.
ln this context, it' s obvious Chicken Little represents the sane vision... and that Homo sapiens' motto, "Let' s go shopping"... is the cry ofthe true lunatic.
I wonder ifyou' re aware of my own studies.
See you at work tomorrow.
Get in the car!
I' ve got a gun.
Drive.
Take my purse.
I' ve got a lot ofcash, credit cards.
- Take my keys.
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.
- Where are we going?
- Philadelphia.
- That' s more than a hundred miles.
- That' s why I can' t walk there.
- Just let me go.
- Just drive!
- I don' t know how to drive.
I went underground when I was eight.
I told you that before.
At the next --
- At the next corner, turn right.
- Cole. James Cole.
You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
Six years foryou.
Come on.
Get goin '.
I can' t believe that this is a coincidence, Mr Cole.
- Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.
I know this isn' t what you meant, but...
I don' t have any money.
I' ve been sleeping on the street.
I' m sure I smell bad.
Do you have any food in this car?
- You have been following me?
No, I saw this... in a store window.
I can read, remember?
Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.
It' s in Philadelphia.
That' s where the ones who did it are.
The Twelve Monkeys.
ls that a radio?
Can you turn it on?
Areyou at the endofyourrope?
Areyou dying toget away?
The Florida Keysare waiting foryou.
Ocean waves --
I' ve never seen the ocean.
It' s an advertisement, Mr Cole.
What?
It' s an advertisement.
You understand that, don' t you?
It' s not really a special message to you.
Mr Cole.
- You used to call meJames.
- You prefer that?
James, you don' t really have a gun --
Can you make this louder?

Theparanoid whopulled the Houdinibackin '90?
Well, he' sback, andhe' s --
lthoughtyou oughta know.
Take care.
It' sjust like I told you.
I don' t know.
She never showed.
That is totally unlike her.
Do you happen to know the make of her car?
'94 Cherokee.
Silver.
lhave done "doed" it, ja.
Oh, boy!
Oh, excuse me, mister.
Excuse me, mister.
Have a cigar.
Nowmytime machine is ready forexperiments.
Ah, the woodpecker!
Yoo- hoo, woodpecker!
You were in my dream just now.
Different colour.
I' m sure it was you.
What was the dream about?
About an airport... before everything happened.
It' s the same dream I always have.
When I was a kid.
And I was in it?
What did I do?
You were very upset.
You' re always very upset in the dream.
Just never knew it was you.
It wasn' t me before, James.
It' s become me now because ofwhat' s happening.
Could you please untie me?
No, I think it was always you.
Very strange.
You' re fushed and you were moaning.
I thinkyou' re running a fever.
What are you doing?
ln Fresno, California, crews continue to attempt to rescue RickyNeuman.
Closerto home, in Baltimore, Kathryn Railly... prominentpsychiatrist andauthorof a newly releasedbook on insanity... disappearedmysteriously last night aftera lecture at the university.
FormermentalpatientJames Cole is wantedforquestioning... regardingDrRailly' s disappearance.
Authorities warn that Cole hasa historyofviolence... andadvise anyonespottinghim to notifyauthoritiesat once.
I love this music.
We don' t have this.
We don' t have anything like this.
What are all those?
These?
My notes, clues.
What kind ofclues?
It' s about the secret army.
They' re the ones that spread the virus.
That' s why I' m here.
I have to find them.
That' s my mission.
Have to locate them because they have the virus in its pure form... before it mutates.
When I locate them, they' il send a scientist back here.
That scientist will study the virus.
When he goes back to the present, he and the scientists will make a cure.
Does that disturb you?
No.
Thought it was about us.
Thought maybe they' d captured us and arrested me.
Just a joke.
I remember being very afraid for that little boy.
All alone, down that well... not knowing ifanybody' s gonna get him out.
First time I was really afraid when I was a kid.
What do you mean, "when you were a kid"?
Just a prank, a hoax.
That boy' s hiding in a barn.
"There are omens and divinations.
One ofthe four beasts gave unto the seven angels... seven golden vials full ofthe wrath of God... who liveth forever and ever. "
You won' t think I' m crazy when people start dying next month.
First they' il think it' sjust some weird fever.
Then they' il find out.
They' il catch on.
Stop here!
Stop the car!
Stop right here!
I was right.
They' re here!
You see?
Twelve Monkeys!
You believe me now?
Come on!
Come on!
They' re here, you see?
Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys.
Come on!
Twelve Monkeys.
Wait, here.
Do you see?
I see some red paint, some marks.
- Marks?
You think that -- - Oh, this is ridiculous.
Don' t -- Don' t you do anything crazy.
Or I' il hurt somebody.
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but none ofthis is what you think it is!
You can' t hide from them, Bob.
I said, you can' t hide from them.
No, sir, ol 'Bob.
Don' t even try.
They hear everything.
They got that tracking device on ya.
They can find you anywhere, anytime!
It' s in the tooth.
Right, Bob?
But I fooled 'em, old buddy.
They don' t have to spy on me.
I' m doing what I' m supposed to be doing.
Here it is again.
See?
Here, follow this paint trail.
It' s here, see?
I am not going --
Come with me!
The paint trail goes here.
James, we shouldn' t be here.
Goddam it!
Leave me alone!
Let' s get out of here.
James, we shouldn' t be here.
Please don' t kill me.
Don' t kill me, please!
Don' t kill me, don' t kill me!
Stick around, bitch.
Are you all right?
ls he alive?
We' re runnin 'out oftime.
- Oh, Jesus!
James, you killed him!
Come on.
- You never had a gun before!
Come on.
"Dragons in their pleasant palaces.
The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air... and there came -- "You!
You' re one of us.
This is it.
Can we help you?
It' sjust a tape.
I' m looking for the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.
We don' t know anything about an Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys sojust disappear.
- Just want some information.
- Didn' t you hear me?
Please, I' m a psychiatrist.
Just do whatever he tells you to do.
He' s disturbed.
He' s dangerous.
- Pleasejust cooperate.
- You want money?
- We only got a few bucks.
- I told you what I want.
Get down.
Lock that door.
- I told you that Goines would get us -- - Shut up!
- Goines?
- Jeffrey Goines?
Jeffrey becomes this big star, and the media latch onto him... because he' s picketing his own father... a famous Nobel- prize- winning virologist.
You must have seen all that on TV.
ls this him?
Yeah, that' s him, that' s him.
What are you gonna do to us?
Tell me more aboutJeffrey.
Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do -- picketing, leafeting, letter- writing stuff.
He said we were ineffectual, liberal jerk- offs.
He wanted to do guerrilla actions in order to educate the public.
- He let 1 00 snakes loose in the Senate.
But we weren' t into that kind ofstuff.
It' s counterproductive.
So he and 1 1 guys, they split off... and formed this underground army.
The Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.
They started planning a "human hunt."
They bought stun guns, nets and bear traps.
They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers.
They didn' t do it, ofcourse.
They didn' t do any of it.
Like always, Mr Big Shot sold his friends out.
He goes on TV and gives this big news conference, tells the world... hejust realized his dad' s experiments are vital for humanity... and that the use ofanimals is absolutely necessary... that from now on, he, Jeffrey Goines, will personally supervise the labs... to make sure all the little animals aren' t going to suffer.
What is this?
People like that aren' t accessible.
You can' tjust barge in on them.
- It' s not how the world works.
- Be quiet and drive the car.
- I know what I' m doing.
This car is stolen, and we are in big trouble.
Big trouble.
lfyou don' t turn yourselfover to the police, they' re going to kill you.
They' re going to shoot me, too, because I' m an accessory to murder.
- You' re all going to die.
- Nobody is going to die.
You' re not going to save the world, okay?
You' re delusional.
You' ve made all this up out of bits and pieces in your head.
- No.
- Yes!
Let me give you an example.
You knowJeffrey Goines.
You were both patients at County Hospital.
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.
He told you that his father was a famous scientist who worked with viruses... so you incorporated that information to this cockeyed fantasy.
He didn' t say his father was a scientist.
He said his father was God.
This is insane.
Prominentpsychiatrist andauthor DrKathryn Raillyhasbeen abducted... bya dangerousmentalpatient, James Cole.
Cole was underRailly' s care sixyears ago... when he made a dramatic escape --
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.
Who shot you?
I don' t know.
It was some kind ofwar.
Never mind.
You wouldn' t believe me anyway.
What are you doing?
- We don' t need gas.
- I thought you didn' t know how to drive.
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn' t say I was stupid.
This can' t go on.
lfyou have a bullet in your leg, I have to take care of it.
I need some supplies.
Meanwhile, in Fresno, California... where mining engineers continue theirattempt... to sinka shaftparallelto the one in which Ricky isbelievedtrapped... authorities saythere isstilla chance the boymight be alive.
You shouldn' t put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.
Lucky foryou, it' s near the surface.
I love seeing the sun.
Wait.
You smell so good.
You have to give yourself up.
You know that?
What are you doing? James?
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!
What are you doing?
- I' m sorry.
- They find him?
- That kid, the one in the pipe.
- You believe that?
They' re lowering a monkey down there... with an infrared camera strapped on him... and a roast beefsandwich wrapped up in tin foil.
- You' re makin 'it up.
- Life is really weird.
- A monkey and a roast beefsandwich.
Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner... and this most stimulating and exciting company... for itself, with no sense of purpose.
But, alas, I am burdened.
For with all this excess of public attention and cacophony of praise... there comes great responsibility.
I don' t have to tell you all that the dangers ofscience... are a timeworn threat.
From Prometheus stealing fire from the gods --
What friend?
But never before --
This is ridiculous.
My father' s giving a major address.... to fear the power... we have at hand.
Normally, ifwe caught a guy... sneaking around with no lD, we' d bust his ass.
Excuse my French.
Since you seem to have had a few unusual associates... we certainly would not want to arrest one ofyour closest pals.
Never seen him before in my life.
Feel free to torture this man, or whatever it is you do.
I' m going back to listen to my father' s eloquent discourse on the perils of --
I' m here about some monkeys.
- Monkeys, yes.
Twelve ofthem.
Arnold.
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?
Ofcourse I know this man.
Gee, Arnie, it' s black tie.
I said, "Drop by."
But it' s Dad' s big do -- VlPs, senators, secret service.
You hungry, Arnie?
Real killer feast we' re putting on.
Lots ofdead lamb, dead cow, dead pig.
Shall we?
How are you?
Hello.
"The Great Escape," 1 990.
Huh?
County Hospital?
Am I right?
I won' t stop you.
I can' t stop you.
- I just want the information.
Hi, ladies.
So nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.
All right.
Who blabbed?
Bruhns?
I just want access to the pure virus.
- Virus?
- I need to know where and what it is.
I get it.
I see what you' re up to.
It' s your old plan, isn' t it?
- What plan?
- I don' t know what you' re talking about.
- Yes, you do.
We were in the day room watching television... and you were upset about the desecration ofthe planet, which I understand.
Then you said, "Wouldn' t it be great to have a germ or virus... that would wipe out mankind and leave the animals and trees?"
- You' re trying to confuse me.
I told you my father was this famous virologist.
You said, "He could make a germ, and we could steal it."
We live underground!
The world belongs to the dogs and cats.
We live like worms.
I just need the information!
- Take it easy.
- You are a nutcase, completely deranged!
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.
Your information tray isjammed, man.
Do you know what it is, the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys?
It' s a collection ofspace- case do- gooders saving rain forests.
I have nothing to do with those bozos any more.
I' ve quit being the rich- kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffective fanatics!
So much foryour grand plot, asshole!
My father has warned people about the dangers... ofexperimenting with DNA viruses foryears.
You processed that information through your addled, paranoid infrastructure.
Lo and behold, a non- profit organization... becomes a sinister, revolutionary cabal!
This man is complete bat shit!
Ladies and gentlemen... do you realize where he thinks he comes from?
Captain Dan Miller, the man in charge ofthe rescue operation... sayshe has consulted with experts... andtheyassure us there willbe no negative --
lfyou ask me, the monkey' s gonna eat that goddam sandwich himself.
Did a man just come running through here?
Hisprimaryresponsibility was to the missingboy.
DrKathryn Railly.
Anybody see someone come through here?
The body wasdiscovered less than an hourago byhikers.
But we have an unconfirmedreport that the victim... a woman in herlate20s orearly30s... wassavagelymutilated.
Earlierin the day, police located Railly' sabandonedcar.
It wasfoundnot farfrom --
Any sign of him?
Nothing.
You bastard!
I could have died in there, you son ofa bitch!
What are you thinking of... you twisted sack ofshit?
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?
Yes.
- A million people, five billion people.
Jeffrey Goines said that it was my idea about the virus.
We were in the institution.
It was all so fuzzy with the drugs.
Do you think maybe I wiped out the human race?
Nobody is gonna wipe out the human race.
Not you orJeffrey or anybody else.
You' ve created something in your mind.
- Whatever.
A substitute reality... because you don' t want to deal with anything.
I would love it ifthat was true.
It can be dealt with, but only ifyou want to.
I can help you.
- They' re after me.
- Who is afteryou?
We have to get out of here.
There were policemen at that party.
Party?
You went to a --
Never mind.
It' s important you surrender instead ofthem catching you running away.
Wouldn' t it be great if I was crazy?
Then the world would be okay.
- Give me the gun.
Where is the gun?
- I lost the gun.
You got water, air, stars.
- I' m gonna attract their attention.
I' m gonna attract their attention so they know where we are.
I love this world!
They' re gonna tell you to put your hands on your head.
I love the frogs, the spiders.
I' il be with you.
I' il help you.
Then I said something about cooperating, and he said he would do that.
So I got in the car.
Thanks.
I started honking the horn, and when I got out, he was gone.
I tell you something.
You lucked out.
For a while we thought you were a body found down state, mutilated.
- He wouldn' t do that.
I want to be clear about this, okay?
This man and the other one were severely beating us.
James Cole didn' t start it.
Funny thing, Doctor.
Maybe you can help explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist and all.
Why do kidnap victims always tell us about the guys that grabbed 'em... and they try to make us understand... how kind these bastards really were.
It' s a normal reaction to a life- threatening situation.
He' s sick, okay?
He thinks he comes from the future.
He lives in a meticulously constructed fantasy world that' s disintegrating.
He needs help.
DrRailly returnedto Baltimore without makingapublicstatement.
The authorandpsychiatrist is currently in seclusion at herhome.
Meantime, police havepiecedtogether a scenario oftheseries ofevents... that began with escaped mentalpatientJames Cole --
- No, it' s okay.
I' m just hyper- alert.
- Did you take a sedative?
- I hate those things.
With the kidnapping ofthe Baltimore woman, James Cole... isnowalso wantedin connection... with the brutalslaying ofRodney Wiggins, an ex- convict fromArdmore.
Hisbody wasdiscovered in an abandonedtheatre... not farfrom where Cole left3 animal rightsactivistsboundandgagged... in theirSecondAvenue headquarters.
Now, do they really believe that he' s going to show up here?
ln Fresno, California, the corn field that wasjammed with spectators --
That little boy.
He' s fine.
It wasjust a prank he and his friends pulled.
The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky Neuman from an abandonedmineshaft... endedabruptly whenplaymates confessed... that Neuman' s disappearance wasaprank.
ln fact, the missing child washiding in a nearbybarn.
On Blueberry Hill
Congratulations, Cole.
Well done.
During your interview, while you were under the infuence... you told us you liked music.
- This isn' t a prison, James.
- This is a hospital.
- Until you recoveryour equilibrium.
- You' re still a little disoriented.
- Time travel is a very stressful thing.
- You stood up very well, considering.
You connected the Twelve Monkeys with a famous virologist and his son.
- Others will take over now.
- We' il be back in service in months.
We' il retake the planet.
This is what you' ve been working for.
- A full pardon.
- You' il be out of here in no time.
- Women will want to get to know you.
- I don' t want your women!
I want to get well!
And you will be well, James.
Soon.
You know, you people don' t exist.
You' re not real.
We can' t travel back in time.
You' re not here.
You can' t trick me.
You' re in my mind.
I am insane, and you are my insanity.
He not only used the word "prank"... he said the boy was hiding in a barn.
Kathryn, Kathryn, he kidnapped you.
You saw him murder somebody... and you knew there was a real possibility... he could kill you too.
You' re under tremendous emotional stress.
For God' s sake, Owen, listen to me.
He knew about the boy in Fresno... and he says five billion people are gonna die.
No way he could possibly know that.
You' re a rational person.
You' re a trained psychiatrist.
You know the difference between what' s real and what' s not.
What we say is the truth is what everybody accepts, right?
Psychiatry is the latest religion.
We decide what' s right and wrong.
We decide who' s crazy or not.
I' m in trouble here.
I' m losing my faith.
Yousure fuckedup, Bob.
But lcan understand.
You don' t wantyourmistakes pointedout toyou.
lcan relate to that, oldBob.
lknow whatyou' re thinkin '.
You' re thinkin' ldon' t exist except inyourhead.
lcan see thatpoint ofview.
Butyou couldstilltalk to me, couldn 'tya?
I saw you... in 1 996, in the real world.
- You pulled out your teeth.
- Why wouldlpullout myteeth, Bob?
That' sa no- no.
And when didyousayyousawme?
- Leave me alone!
Yellin 'won' tgetyou whatyou want.
You have to besmart toget whatyou want.
- What do I want?
- You don' t know whatyou want?
Sureyou do, Bob.
You know whatyou want.
Tell me what I want.
To see theskyandthe ocean... to be topside... breathe the air... to be with her.
lsn 't that right?
lsn 't that whatyou want?
Jim Halperin, Philly PD.
Sorry to call you so early.
You found him? ls he okay?
Au contraire, Doctor.
No sign ofyour good friend, the kidnapper.
However, the plot does thicken.
I got a ballistics report here on my desk.
It says the bullet you claim you removed from Cole' s thigh... is, in fact, an antique.
Andallindicationsare... it wasfiredsometime priorto the 1920s.
- Howabout ltake a spin down there?
- This can' t be.
You andlcangrab a bite to eat... and maybe you could revise or amplify your statement.
You can' t trick us, you know.
No, sir.
You haven' t become addicted, haveyou... to that dying world?
I just want to do my part to get us back on top... in charge ofthe planet.
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.
He really is the most qualified.
But all that behaviour.
You said we weren' t real.
I don' t think the human mind is meant to exist... in two different... whateveryou called it, dimensions?
It' sjust too stressful.
You said that yourself.
You don' t know what' s real and what' s not.
Butyou know what' s realnow.
No, I don' t know anything about... a monkey army, Doctor.
No, nothing whatsoever.
Good Lord, if my son was ever involved in something like that --
Well, I' m sorry.
I think it' s doubly inappropriate to discuss... security matters with you, Dr Railly.
But if it will ease your mind... rest assured that neither my son... nor any other unauthorized person... has access to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory.
ls that clear to you now?
Thankyou so much foryour concern.
Women psychiatrists!
I attended a lecture of hers once.
"Apocalyptic Visions."
She was suddenly struck... by the most preposterous notion aboutJeffrey.
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?
Maybe we ought to review our security procedures.
Perhaps upgrade 'em, you know?
Beef' em up.
Let' s consider again our current information.
It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 1 3, 1 996.
And was seen sequentially after that in --
San Francisco, New Orleans...
Rio deJaneiro...
Rome, Kinshasa...
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
That was very well done.
lfyou' re in there, I have to talk to you!
It' s the kidnap woman.
The one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Turn offthe lights.
Turn offthe light!
- She' s drawing attention to us.
I don' t know what you' re up to, but you' re gonna get us in deep shit.
Walkies ready, batteries charged?
I saw somebody in there!
Secret experiments.
That' s what they do.
Secret, weird stuff.
- Notjust on animals.
- I know you.
- Do 'em on people too down at -- - Have you seenJames Cole?
They' re watching you.
- Takin 'pictures.
- The police.
I know.
I have to contactJames.
It' s very, very important that he' s really careful when he reaches me.
Do you understand that?
- Who' sJames?
He was with me.
He spoke to you several weeks ago.
He said that you were from the future and that you were watching him.
Bolt cutters.
Did you get the bolt cutters?
They' re in the van.
- The plans for the security system?
- You know what she' s doin 'out there?
- What' s it say?
I can' t see it.
Forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand.
Your psychiatrist?
- Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex- psychiatrist.
This woman was your psychiatrist... and now she' s spray- painting our building?
- What?
- There' s a policeman over there.
- Pretend you don' t know me.
- I want to turn myself in.
- Where is he?
- James!
I' m not crazy any more.
I mean, I am.
I know that now.
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.
Let' s get outta here.
He' s going.
- I' ve seen that before.
- No, you haven' t.
A guy in a Ford is chasing her and some other guy I can' t see.
No problem.
It' s probably just another kidnapping... featuringJeffrey' s shrink.
Pardon me.
Make that ex- shrink.
This is your leader?
A certifiable lunatic... who told his former psychiatrist all his plans... for God knows what wacko irresponsible schemes?
God knows what she' s written on that wall!
Who cares what psychiatrists write on walls?
You think I told her about the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys?
lmpossible!
Do you know why?
Do you know why?
Because, you pathetically ineffectual... and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals, I' il tell you why.
Because when I had anything to do with her six years ago... there was no such thing, I hadn' t thought of it yet.
Then how come she knows what' s going on?
Well, here' s my theory on that.
When I was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively... in the guise of mental health.
I was examined thoroughly.
Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer... where they created this model of my mind.
Using that model... they managed to generate every thought...
I could possibly have in the next ten years... which they then filtered through a probability matrix ofsome kind... to determine everything I was gonna do in that period.
So, you see... she knew I was gonna lead the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys... into the pages of history before it even occurred to me.
She knows everything I' m ever gonna do before I know it myself.
How' s that?
Kweskin, you finish here.
I' il meet you there.
And ifyou forget one thing, I' il have you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.
- Jeff?
- What?
You' re a great man.
Fuck the bozos!
He' s seriously crazy.
You know that.
There.
Over there.
Come on.
- I need a room.
- Thirty- five bucks an hour.
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours?
Go someplace else.
Here' s... twenty- five, six, seven for an hour.
Deal?
One hour, honey babe.
Number 64.
Up the stairs, end ofthe hall.
Elevator' s busted.
She' s a doctor.
My psychiatrist.
Understand?
Whatever gets it up foryou, Jack.
Tommy, this is Charlie over at the Globe.
You know ifWallace has a new girl?
A little weird?
Okay, you were standing there looking up at the moon.
You were splashing through the water, and then what?
I thought I was in prison again.
Just like that, you were in prison?
No, not really.
Like you said, it was all in my mind.
You disappeared.
One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone.
Did you run through the woods, or --
I don' t know.
I don' t remember.
The boy in the well.
How did you know that wasjust a hoax?
I didn' t know.
You said he was hiding in a barn!
I think I maybe saw a TV show about that... when I was a kid where a boy --
It wasn' t a TV show!
It was real!
Maybe this boy saw the same TV show that I did... and he copied it.
Look, you were right.
I am mentally ill.
I imagined all these things, these people.
I know they' re not real.
I can trick them.
I worked on 'em a little bit.
I got back here to get better.
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?
I think I had a dream about this.
You had a bullet from World War I in your leg.
How did it get there?
You said I had delusions, that I created this world.
- You said you could explain.
I' m trying to, and --
I can' t believe that everything we say or do has already happened.
We can' t change what' s gonna happen.
And iffive billion people are gonna die, it' s --
I want the future to be unknown.
I want to become a whole person again.
I want this to be the present.
I want to stay here this time... with you.
Do you remember six years ago you had a phone number?
- It was the wrong number then.
It was the wrong number in 1 990.
It should be the right number now.
Do you remember it?
The number.
This is my territory, bitch!
- ls this real or one of my delusions?
- This is definitely real.
Excuse me.
I think we' ve got a little misunderstanding here.
- Yeah.
We -- - Gee, really?
Now, you just sit tight, chief.
You listen to me, little Miss Understanding.
You thinkyou can go around me and peddle your ass in this part oftown?
You bet your life we got what I would call... a major fuckin 'misunderstanding.
James, no!
Don' t!
Put him in the closet.
Take his money first!
- You want me to rob him?
- We need cash!
Call the cops!
Call the cops!
I' ve got friends, man.
Don' t fuckin 'kill me.
No, James!
Open the door!
What the fuck are you doing?
Please don' t hurt him.
Open the door.
James, come on.
Just in case --
Just in case I' m not crazy, this is how they find us.
By our teeth.
I don' t want them to find me ever.
I don' t want to go back.
Step back.
You' d better load.
Police!
Throw your weapons out and come on out!
Hey! ls that the cops?
I' m the innocent victim here.
I was attacked by a coked- up whore... and a fuckin 'crazy dentist.
Try to blend in.
Oh, Jesus!
Come on.
There' s gotta be a phone around here somewhere.
Over there.
Look.
I' m gonna try that number, okay?
Let' s hope it' s nothing.
It' s okay!
We' re insane.
We' re crazy.
It' s a carpet cleaning company.
- A carpet cleaning company?
No superiors.
No scientists.
No men from the future.
It' sjust a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.
You leave a message telling where you want your carpet cleaned.
- You left them a message?
- Yeah, I couldn' t resist.
Wait till they hear this nutty woman telling them to watch out... for the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.
"ls the secret headquarters of the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.
They' re the ones who are gonna do it.
I can' t do anything more now.
Have a merry Christmas. "
You couldn' t have heard me.
They got your message.
They played it for me.
It was a bad recording, distorted.
I didn' t recognize your voice.
This.
And this.
And this.
You want anything?
Shall I put this on your account, ma' am?
That' il be cash.
Can you tell me what foor the wigs are on?
You turned the thing into a fucking computer.
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.
I' ve never seen you before in my fuckin 'life. "
Come on, come on.
Bring him through.
Drive!
What' s the harm in openin 'up the bag?
His eyes are taped, right?
Right?
Hello.
Hello.
Wanna hear the monkey speak?
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that' s you.
- I recognize your voice.
- No, you don' t.
I also know all about your warped little plan.
She told me.
I didn' t believe her.
ltjust seemed too crazy, even foryou.
Butjust in case, I took steps... to make sure that you couldn' t go through with it.
I don' t have the code any more.
I don' t have access to the virus.
I took myselfout ofthe loop.
Too late!
Too late!
We' ve got plans foryou, Dad.
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it' s true.
Jeffrey?
You' re completely insane.
No, I' m not.
There' sa crosssection ofone of the oldtrees that' sbeen cut down.
Here I wasborn.
Andthere ldied.
It was onlya moment foryou.
You tookno notice.
I think I' ve seen this movie before.
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don' t talk.
- I did see it before.
- Talltrees.
Haveyou been here before?
- When?
- But I don' t recognize this -- - When wereyou born?
What' s the matter?
Tellme.
Madeleine, tellme.
It' sjust like what' s happening with us.
Like the past.
It can' t change.
But every time you see it, it seems different because you' re different.
You see different things.
lfyou can' t change anything because it' s already happened... you may as well smell the fowers.
What fowers?
It' s an expression.
Why are you doing this?
I want to know why.
What if I' m wrong?
What ifyou' re wrong?
What if I am crazy?
ln a few weeks, it will have started or it won' t.
TV shows and armed robberies... we' re going to be so glad... that we' il be thrilled to see the police.
Do you have a plan?
You said you' d never seen the ocean.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Jeffrey?
You know I can' t see.
Where are we?
Jeffrey?
Please.
We have 9: 30 reservations for Key West.
I just didn' t recognize you.
Well, you look pretty different yourself.
It was always you.
ln my dream.
It was always you.
I rememberyou like this.
You do?
I felt I' ve known you before.
I feel like I' ve always known you.
I' m so scared.
What time' s your fight, friends?
- 9: 30.
- Might be tight.
No.
My watch says 7: 30.
On your normal mornin ', okay.
Plenty oftime.
But today you gotta take into account your Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys factor.
What?
What' d you say?
Twelve Monkeys.
ln case you folks didn' t turn on your radio this mornin '.
Bunch ofweirdos let all the animals out ofthe zoo.
Then they locked up this big- shot scientist in one ofthe cages.
Scientist' s own kid one ofthe ones did it.
They' ve got animals all over the place.
Bunch ofzebras closed down the thruway about an hour ago.
It' s got traffic blocked for miles on 676.
That' s what they were up to -- freeing animals.
On the walls.
It said, "We did it."
They meant the animals.
I think it' s gonna be all right.
Tell your people ifthey spot either one ofthem not to try and apprehend them.
They should notify us.
We have people all over the airport.
We' il take care of it.
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.
This is my dream.
- Your moustache.
- It' s notjust my dream.
I remember now.
About a week or two before everyone started dying.
Careful.
They might be looking for us.
- I was here as a kid.
- Use this.
I thinkyou were here then too.
lfthey identify us, they' re going to send us someplace... but it won' t be Key West.
I' il go fix this.
I' m gonna get the tickets.
I' il meet you in the newspaper stand.
Judy Simmons.
I have reservations for Key West.
- I don' t see a lot ofthis.
- It' s a long story.
We' il begin boarding in about 20 minutes.
- Thankyou.
I don' t know whether you' re there or not.
Maybe you just clean carpets.
lfyou do, you' re lucky.
You' re gonna live a long, happy life.
But ifyou other guys are out there, ifyou' re picking this up... forget about the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.
They didn' t do it.
It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.
The Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys isjust a bunch ofdumb kids... playing revolutionaries.
Listen, I' ve done myjob.
I did what you wanted.
Good luck.
I' m not coming back.
San Francisco, New Orleans...
Rio deJaneiro, Rome...
Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok and Peking.
This is some trip you' re taking, sir.
ls this all in one week?
Business.
Have a good one, sir.
Got yourselfa prob, Bob?
Leave me alone!
I made a report.
I didn' t have to do that.
You don' t belong here.
It' s not permitted to let you stay.
This is the present.
This is not the past.
This is not the future.
This is right now!
I' m not leaving!
Get that?
You can' t stop me.
Anything you say, chief.
It' s none of my business.
- Hey, Cole.
Calm down, Cole.
It' s me.
Cole, it' s me.
- Jose?
- Yeah, right, Jose.
Why' d you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.
- Here, take this.
- What for?
Are you crazy?
Me?
Are you kidding?
You' re the one.
You' re a hero, man.
They pardoned you, and you come back and fuck with your teeth.
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.
They did their reconstruction thing on it.
The phone -- The phone call I just made?
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.
Thirty years ago.
Theyjust put it together.
"Uh, hey, this is Cole, James.
I don' t know whetheryou' re there or not.
Maybe you just clean carpets. "
Where' d you get that from?
"Forget about the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys."
Man, ifonly they could' ve got your message earlier.
You could still be a hero ifyou cooperate!
It' s okay.
- $6. 50' s your change.
Thankyou.
- Thankyou.
Oh, my God!
I got orders to shoot the lady ifyou don' t go along this time.
- What?
- Yeah, you got that?
- They said, "lf Cole don' t obey --" - I' il breakyour fuckin 'head!
You hear me?
Volunteersnowboarding atgate37.
You see?
I had no choice.
These are my orders, man.
Just take it.
Take it!
This part isn' t about the virus at all, is it?
It' s about following orders, about doing what you' re told.
Hey, man, you got a pardon.
What do you want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
James!
It' s Dr Goines' assistant.
He' s an apocalypse nut.
The next fight to San Francisco leaves from gate 38.
lf he' s there, I' m sure he' s part of it.
Mr Holtz, you wanna have a look at this, please?
Sir, would you mind letting me have a look at the contents ofyour bag?
We don' t have time for this.
Excuse me.
Biological samples.
I have the papers right here.
I' m gonna have to askyou to open this up, sir.
Open it?
Why, yes, ofcourse.
What could be better?
- Excuse me.
- Ma' am, you have to get in the line.
You see?
Biological.
Check the papers.
It' s all proper.
I have a permit.
- It' s empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.
It looks empty, but I assure you, it' s not.
- You don' t understand.
- I don' t have to.
This is very important.
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.
It doesn' t even have an odour.
That' s not necessary, sir.
There you go.
Thankyou foryour cooperation.
Have a good fight.
- Who are you calling a moron?
- A fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her!
Hold it!
Wait a moment.
There he is!
That man!
He' s carrying a deadly virus!
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!
Police officer.
Watch it!
Excuse me.
It' s obscene.
All the violence, all the lunacy.
Shootings even at airports now.
You might say that we' re the next endangered species.
Human beings.
I thinkyou' re right, ma' am.
I thinkyou' ve hit the nail on the head.
Jones is my name.
I' m in insurance.
I find it impossible to deny the power of the government' s position.
There is no doubt in my mind that District Attorney Holabird,
Her Catholic Majesty, lsabella of Spain, and her trusted minister, Senor Calderon, have all proceeded with the utmost faith in the soundness of their case.
I also believe that Senors Ruiz and Montes may have... misrepresented the origin of the prisoners, an issue which weighs crucially upon their fate, and that of the Spaniards as well.
Were they born in Africa?
Since the answer to that question shall govern every determination of this court, I ask it again.
Were they born in Africa?
I believe they were.
Neither do those for salvage made by Lieutenants Mead and Gedney.
I hereby order the arrest and detention of Senors Ruiz and Montes..
By federal marshals... on the charge of slave- trading!
Yes!
We' ve done it, Joadson!
Yes!
Covey, tell them!
Tell them now!
Look at 'em!
What' s most bewildering to Her Majesty is this arrogant independence of the American courts.
After all, if you cannot rule the courts, you cannot rule.
Senor Calderon, as any true American will tell you, its the independence of our courts that keeps us free.
John... "m glad you came.
Senator Calhoun is here.
John!
I was afraid you weren' t going to be able to join us.
- You may put that fear to rest, sir.
Please.
I' d like you to meet Senor Calderon, ambassador from Spain.
Buenas noches, Senor Ambassador.
- Thought you said he wasn' t coming.
You see, Senor Calderon, there' s a growing number of people in this part of the country that regard us in the South as not only geographically beneath them.
They ignore the fact that slavery is so interwoven into the fabric of this society, that to destroy it would be to destroy us as a people.
That' s all they know.
Therefore, so are we.
lmmoral and inferior.
We are inferior in one area.
We' re not as proficient in the art of gain.
We' re not as wealthy as our northern neighbors.
We' re still struggling.
Well, we all know what happens then.
They become the masters, and we the slaves.
But not without a fight.
Senator Calhoun is being modest.
He' s not inferior in another area - the art of exaggeration.
What court wants to be responsible for the spark that ignites the firestorm?
What president wants to be in office... when it comes crashing down around him?
Certainly no court before this one.
Certainly no president before this one.
Judge us not too harshly, sir, and bid Her Majesty like.
Because the real determination our courts and our president must make is not whether this ragtag group of Africans raised swords against their enemy, but rather... must we?
Come along, Mr Joadson.
This news...
Martyrdom, Mr Joadson.
From the dawn of Christianity, we have seen no stronger power for change.
You know it' s true.
What is true, Mr Tappan - and believe me when I tell you, "ve seen this - is that there are men whose hatred of slavery is stronger than anything, except for the slave himself.
If you wish to inspire such hatred in a man, Mr Joadson, speak to him in that fashion and it may come true.
Our president, our big, big man, has appealed the decision to our Supreme Court.
What does that mean?
We have to try the case again.
Now, l- I know it' s hard to understand, Cinque.
I don' t understand, for that matter.
You said there would be a judgment, and we would go free.
No, no.
What I said is that we won it at the state level.
I said if we won it at the state level, we then go on.
- That' s what you said!
- That' s what you said!
Yes, I said it!
I said it, but I shouldn' t have.
What I should have said...
- I can' t translate that.
- You can' t translate what?
- I can' t translate "should".
- There' s no Mende word for "should"?
Either you do something, or you don' t do it.
What I meant to say, what I MEANT...
You' re misunderstanding the language.
Listen to me.
Understand what "m saying.
What I said to you before the judgment is almost how it works here.
- Almost!
Almost?
But not always.
"Massachusetts member, House of Representatives.
"lf that is true, then you are aware that we have been,
"Despite this,
"to the highest court in the land.
"are themselves Southern slave owners.
"Sir, we need you.
"and array himself for battle, that time has come."
Thank you.
"Cicero said, appealing to Claudius in defence of the Republic,
"depends on the life of one most brave and excellent man. '
"ln our time, in this instance, I believe it depends on two.
"and you, sir.
"Sincerely, Roger S Baldwin, attorney- at- law."
Mr Tippings, excuse me a moment, please.
- What did Cinque say?
He won' t talk to you.
He won' t talk to me?
No.
How' s your English coming?
No better than my Mende, I suppose.
Cinque, I know this isn' t something you necessarily want to think about, but has it occurred to you that "m all you' ve got?
Because, since my practice has now completely deteriorated, you' re all "ve got.
See, this is me.
You see?
You see how this works?
And- And- And this, this here, Cinque, is for me.
More death threats.
By my own clients, no less.
I should say, should say... former clients, shouldn' t l?
There is one more consequence to having no clientele to speak of.
I am now free to sit here as long as it takes for you to acknowledge me.
Yes, you understood that word, didn' t you?
All right.
Caesar.
Cicero' s appeal was to Julius Caesar, not Claudius.
Claudius would not be born for another hundred years.
You were right, there was one of them.
- Is that him?
- Yes, Mr President.
Please unlock this door.
- How old is he?
- Too old to take anyone home!
He sleeps through three quarters of the sessions on the Hill.
Let' s see.
President, slumbering congressman, jailhouse lawyer - one waits with great anticipation for what' s next!
- What must that be like?
Knowing all your life, whatever your accomplishments, you' il only be remembered as the son of a great father.
The only thing John Quincy Adams will remembered for is his middle name!
I wonder, is there anything as pathetic as an ex- president?
I was talking about John...
- Sir.
- Yes?
Cinque has asked me t- t- to ask you... whether you have thought about the question of jurisdiction.
What?
That since they took over the ship far out to sea, and since neither Spain nor America owns the sea, how is it that the treaty applies?
Tell him the treaty recognises no jurisdictional limitations.
- Well?
- He will ask me why.
Because I said so.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
Cinque would like to know that if he is the property of Ruiz and Montes, then how does the treaty apply, as it is between America and Spain?
Or their citizens.
"Or their citizens" is included in the language, if he must know.
It' s a good point, though.
- those between Spain and America?
- No.
- which might override those...
- No.
Does America have treaties with West Africa?
No!
- Does Spain?
- No!
Does the Commonwealth of Connecticut
- have any treaties with West Africa?
Now stop this!
Unshackle him.
I' m sorry, sir. - "m under strict orders...
Yes, Mr President.
I brought over from China.
And this is a primrose from an English garden.
And, uh, this spear lily, from the south of France.
Hmm.
Go on, go on.
I can' t tell you how difficult that was to come by.
Now, you understand you' re going to the Supreme Court.
Do you know why?
No.
Well, yes, that may be true too.
That' s not what I meant.
Although I' il admit that, uh, perhaps more so to us than you.
All right, don' t...
Cinque...
Do you know who I am?
Has anyone told you about me?
- What have they told you?
That you are a chief.
I was a chief, yes.
A chief cannot become anything less than a chief, even in death.
You' ve no idea.
One tries to govern wisely, strongly, but...
One tries to... kill the lion.
Unfortunately, one isn' t always wise enough or strong enough.
Time passes... and the moment is gone.
Now, listen, Cinque.
We' re about...
We' re about to bring your case before the highest court in our land.
Were about to do battle with a lion that is threatening to rip our country in two.
And all we have on our side is a rock.
Of course, you didn' t ask to be at the centre of this historic conflagration any more than I did, but we find ourselves here, nonetheless, by some mysterious mix of circumstances and the whole world watching.
Huh?
- l- I...
Sorry, I didn' t catch it.
Cinque, look. "m being honest with you.
Anything less would be disrespectful.
I suppose "m explaining to you, that the test ahead of us is an exceptionally difficult one.
- We won' t be going in there alone.
Alone? lndeed not.
We have right at our side.
We have righteousness at our side.
We have Mr Baldwin over there.
I meant my ancestors.
I will call into the past, far back to the beginning of time, and beg them to come and help me at the judgment.
I will reach back and draw them into me.
And they must come, for at this moment, I am the whole reason they have existed at all.
I derive much consolation from the fact that my colleague, Mr Baldwin here, has argued the case in so able, and so complete a manner as to leave me scarcely anything to say.
Why are we here?
How is it that a simple, plain property issue should now find itself so ennobled as to be argued before the Supreme Court of the United States of America?
Do we fear the lower courts, which found for us, missed the truth?
And now would have us disregard truth even as it stands before us, tall and proud as a mountain.
The truth... in truth, has been driven from this case like a slave.
But through the long, powerful arm of the executive office.
This is no mere property case, gentlemen.
Because what it in fact concerns is the very nature of man.
Uh, these are, um...
These are transcriptions of letters written between our secretary of state, John Forsyth, and the Queen of Spain, lsabella the Second.
Now, I ask that you accept their perusal as part of your deliberations.
Thank you, sir.
I would not touch on them now except to notice a curious phrase which is much repeated.
The Queen again and again refers to our incompetent courts.
Huh?
A court that finds against the Africans?
Well, I think not.
And here is the fine point of it.
What Her Majesty wants is a court that behaves just like her courts.
The courts this 11- year- old child plays with in her magical kingdom called Spain.
A court that will do what it is told.
A court that can be toyed with like a doll.
A court, as it happens, of which our own president,
Martin Van Buren, would be most proud.
Thank you.
This is a publication of the office of the President.
It' s called "The Executive Review", and "m sure you all read it.
At least "m sure the President hopes you all read it.
This is a recent issue, and there' s, uh, an article in here, written by "a keen mind of the South", who...
My former vice- president, John Calhoun, perhaps.
Could it be?
"in which one segment did not thrive upon the labour of another.
"history bears this out.
"Slavery has always been with us,
"Rather, as war and antagonism are the natural states of man,
"so, too, slavery, as natural as it is inevitable."
Well, gentlemen, I differ with the keen minds of the South, and with our president, who apparently shares their views, offering that the natural state of mankind is instead - and I know this is a controversial idea - is freedom.
Is freedom.
He will break loose his chains.
He will try and try and try, against all odds, against all prejudices, to get home.
Cinque, would you stand up, if you would, so everyone can see you:
We can all see that.
But can we also see as easily that which is equally true?
That he is the only true hero in this room.
If he were white, he wouldn' t be in this court, fighting for his life.
If he were white and his enslavers British, he' d be weighed down by the medals and honours we would bestow upon him.
Songs would be written about him.
The great authors of our times would fill books about him.
His story would be told and retold, in our classrooms.
Our children, because we would make sure of it, would know his name as well as they know Patrick Henry' s.
"The Declaration of lndependence"?
"All men created equal," "inalienable rights," "life, liberty," and so on.
What on Earth are we to do with this?
I have a modest suggestion.
The other night I was talking with my friend Cinque.
He was over at my place, and we were out in the greenhouse together.
He explained to me how when a member of the Mende - that' s his people...
How when a member of the Mende encounters a situation where there appears no hope at all, he invokes his ancestors.
Tradition.
The Mende believe that if one can summon the spirit of one' s ancestors, then they have never left.
And the wisdom and strength they fathered and inspired will come to his aid.
James Madison, Alexander Hamilton,
George Washington,
We have long resisted asking you for guidance.
Perhaps we have feared in doing so, we might acknowledge that our individuality, which we so, so revere, is not entirely our own.
Perhaps were feared an... an appeal to you might be taken for weakness.
But we have come to understand, finally, that this is not so.
We' ve been made to understand, and to embrace the understanding that who we are is who we were.
We desperately need your strength and wisdom to triumph over our fears, our prejudices, ourselves.
Give us the courage to do what is right.
And if it means civil war, then let it come.
And when it does, may it be, finally, the last battle of the American Revolution.
That' s all I have to say.
In the case of the United States of America versus the Amistad Africans, it is the opinion of this court that our treaty of 1795 with Spain, on which the prosecution has primarily based its arguments, is inapplicable.
"are to be returned entirely to their proprietary."
It has not been shown to the court' s satisfaction that these particular Africans fit that description.
We are then left with the alternative that they are not slaves, and therefore cannot be considered merchandise, but are, rather, free individuals with certain legal and moral rights, including the right to engage in insurrection against those who would deny them their freedom.
And therefore, over one dissent, it is the court' s judgment that the defendants are to be released from custody at once, and, if they so choose, to be returned to their homes in Africa.
Thank you.
- What did you say to them?
What words did you use to persuade them?
- Yours.
To keep you safe.
Thank you... Baldwin.

Well, they' re allowed.
I just don' t like them here for obvious reasons.
You know, there was a man that lived here once... that had a prizefiiqhtinq kanqaroo.
Well, you just wouldn' t believe... what that kanqaroo did to this courtyard.
Let' s qo see your aunt' s apartment.

Of course, I' d rather be known as a qreat actress than a movie star.
<i>But, you know, sometimes</ i> <i>people end up beinq both. </ i>
So that is, I quess you' d say, sort of why I came here.

Where were you hurt?
Oh, we should call a doctor.

It will be okay if I sleep.
I just need to lie down here and sleep.
You see, Adam, there are some suqqestions... that are to be brouqht forward.

What' s on your mind?
Well, now, here' s a man who wants to qet riqht down to it.
Kinda anxious to qet to it, are ya?
Whatever.
A man' s attitude ——
A man' s attitude qoes some ways... to the way his life will be.
Is that somethinq you miqht aqree with?
Sure.
Now, did you answer... because that' s what you thouqht I wanted to hear, or did you think about what I said... and answer 'cause you truly believe that to be riqht?
I aqree with what you said.
Truly.
What' d I say?
That a man' s attitude determines, to a larqe extent, how his life will be.
So since you aqree, you must be a person who does not care about the qood life.
How' s that?
Well, stop for a little second and think about it.
Can you do that for me?
[Chuckles]
Okay, I' m thinkin '.
No, you' re not thinkin '.
You' re too busy bein 'a smart aleck to be thinkin'.
Now, I want you to think and stop bein 'a smart aleck.
Can you try that for me?
Look, where' s this qoinq?
What do you want me to do?
There' s sometimes a buqqy.
How many drivers does a buqqy have?

It' s just for a niqht or two, until she fiinds her own place.
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad... and her plane was leavinq, and she qot it all mixed up.
I kept tellinq her that it was my friend Rita, and she kept sayinq she didn' t know any Ritas.
Look at me straiqht, sweetie.
Coco.
She' s very nice.
Honey, you' re a qood kid.
But what you' re tellinq me is a load of horse puckey, even thouqh it comes from a qood place.

Look, you don' t rush it, I don' t rush it, okay?

Get out.
Get out before I call my dad.
He trusts you.
You' re his... best friend.
This will be the end of everythinq.
What about you?
What' il your dad think about you?

You know Woody Katz is only doinq it for a favor.
And the cast, I hear, so far is terrible.
Oh, God, terrible.

He was very nice, and he seemed so sweet.
And Wally —— Mr. Brown —— is a very close friend of my aunt' s, and ——
Settle down, Betty.
Don' t qet me wronq.

I was married to him for ten years.

You better have his money.
I got it.
I' m gonna have it.
What' s the score?
You' re into Duffy for at least five grand.
Who gave you an account?
I laid six grand with the Barber to get me even.
Chicago' s down by four.
- I got Chicago gettin 'eight.
- Less than a minute to go.
Hang on!
Just hang on.
Did you bet the Barber with my money?
You' re not that stupid.
Shut up, Duffy.
In 18 seconds, you' il have your money.
Oh, and he gets hammered, and in it goes!
Shit!
Okay, if he makes both, it' s eight.
I push.
I' m even.
Flagrant foul.
He shoots that first.
- That' s bullshit!
- You' re screwed if he makes three.
Grab him!
Get off of me!
I' m first, O' Neill!
You always pay me first!
You wanna kick my ass?
No one can kick my ass better than I can.
Hey, Conor, it' s Ticky!
Did you bring money for the summons?
- What' s that?
- Did you bring money to get me out?
- Damn, you got "zactly' s" breath.
- "Zactly' s breath"?
Damn, that' s nasty.
Did you pay them?
They said it' s 580.
- I need the tickets.
- Which ones?
You got two pair on the floor for the Bulls- Rockets.
I' m gonna hawk those myself.
The game' s not till 7: 00.
- It' s 5: 00.
Tell me where they are.
- What?
- Shit.
- Come on.
They' re under the religious statue on my dresser.
Wait, Ticky!
You gotta get 1, 200.
- You gotta pay to get me out!
- I already did.
- Yeah?
- It' s Ticky.
Let me in.
Ticky.
Thank God.
I really need that money.
How much did you get for the tickets?
Jesus!
Hey, O' Neill.
They grabbed me outside the United Center.
- Yeah, you' re the Barber' s son.
- Yeah.
Remember making that phone call from Michael Pistone' s wedding?
- Get off of me.
- You talked to me.
You said, "This is O' Neill, number 55.
What' s my limit? "
So I check 55, and I see you got six grand.
So you put that six grand down on Milwaukee, and they tank.
So I ask my old man about O' Neill on 55, and guess what he tells me.
- That guy died four months ago.
- Look, tell the Barber --
You bet six grand on your dead father' s account.
- I need some money right now!
- I' il give you everything I got.
All right.
That' s a start.
Relax.
Forty- seven dollars.
All right, you owe 6, 600.
You pay me a grand a week until I say stop.
- That' s ridiculous.
500.
- 750.
Bring it to the barber shop.
You don' t want me to come back here.
They grabbed me outside the United Center!
Excuse me.
I' m Conor O' Neill.
I got an 11: 30 with James Fleming.
Can you lend me... twelve grand?
What -- do you need to bury your father again?
What?
Did you dig the guy up or something?
- What are you, freakin 'sick?
- I' m sick?
Four months ago you come in here crying... about how you need $5, 000 to bury your old man.
I talked to Mahoney at Mikey' s wedding.
It seems he also gave you 5, 000 to bury the guy.
And I' m gonna pay Mahoney back.
I don' t give a shit how much you owe Mahoney.
Listen, Jimmy, I' m really up against it right now with Duffy --
And I really don' t give a shit how much you owe the bookies.
Come back in here.
You know, this... just might help you.
- Jimmy, this is only 500 bucks.
- I know.
You' re going to coach a kids' baseball team with me.
Jimmy, I don' t think you understand how serious my situation is.
I' m gonna pay you $500 a week for the next ten weeks.
That' s week one.
- Jimmy, I ain' t no good with kids.
- You know, Conor...
I do this to give something back to the community.
You don' t want to do it, give me the check back.
So, I' il see you at the field tomorrow.
- 3: 30.
- Where is it?
Right behind that Baptist church where you used to buy reefer.
The only thing behind that church is those shitty housing projects.
I' il see you tomorrow.
I' il whack this shit to the gate.
You ain' t gonna mess with me.
Shit.
Yo, check out Coach Jimmy' s whip!
Oh, damn, this shit is pimped.
Whoa, guys, don' t touch the car.
Yo, Coach Jimmy.
Here' s my extra inhaler... and here' s my Sugar Babies for when my blood needs sugar.
Mom says I do better when my blood' s got sugar in it.
What' s your name again?

But -- - Everybody listen!
That gentleman behind you is Coach Conor.
He' il be taking over the day- to- day operations.
- What?
- That bum guy' s our coach?
Coach Conor just stopped by to give you the equipment.
Jimmy, I can' t do this by myself.
Here' s your roster, schedule, Sugar Babies, inhaler.
I gotta be in New York three weeks.
Training seminar.
Can' t be avoided.
- Good luck.
- Hey, wait, Jimmy.
- Wait.
- What' s wrong with that man?
Wait, wait, wait!
How am I gonna get my money?

He says he can pitch, Coach Conor, but I might pitch too.
- What' s your name?

Mom says I can play anywhere.
My asthma and all, I should probably play first.
I gotta keep my sugar up too.
You know, Mom said that some boys just plain big- boned.
And some boys just plain fat- assed.
Hi.
Matt Hyland, head of the coaches' committee.
- You the Kekambas?

- Are you the Kekambas?
- Yeah, bitch, we the Kekambas.
So, what' s up?
Where' s James Fleming from Smyth and Stevens Securities?
He' s out of town on business.
I' m assisting him.
What do you got -- six or seven kids?
If you can' t field a team, the league' il drop ya.
I' il tell Coach Fleming --
This is Darryl Mackey.
He' s the president of the league.
Last year was a mess.
We had to cancel games because we' d show up... and the other team would have five kids.
Waste of everybody' s time.
We' re just trying to save everyone a whole lot of trouble, okay?
If you can' t field a nine- man team, you and the Kekambas should go home.
Talk to Jimmy Fleming at Smyth and Stevens Securities... and submit a roster by Friday.
- Friday.
- All right?
Yo, Coach.
Kofi and Ray Ray want to play.
Is that Kofi Evans and...
- Raymont Bennet?
- Yeah, Coach.
But Miss Wilkes ain' t gonna let them play.
Wait, hey, hey!
Who' s Miss Wilkes?
She teaches Saint Malachy.
She gets on my damn nerves, I swear to God!
She is real mean, Coach.
She' s an old nasty lady.
She tell your moms every little thing.
Do you know she called my house every night last year?
Every night.
- She won' t let these guys play?
- Hell, no!
She said they couldn' t play ball until they do these book reports.
- Kofi ain' t doin 'shit.
- Ray Ray neither.
They' re like...
"Bitch, quit that noise."
Hey, can we cool it with the "bitches"?
Shit, man.
Coach, it' s gettin 'kinda late.
We gotta go soon.
We practicin '?
Not today.
Thursday, 4: 00 here.

- Whatever, man.
I don' t wanna walk through folks' loop.
Damn Disciples.
Glock, nine millimeter.
Hey, you know about my karate right?
- Man, do you mean karate?
- Nah, it' s karate.
Learned it from my cousin who was in Japan in the army.
Lightning quick!
This is the tiger.
No man can defend himself from the fury of a karate tiger man.
Yeah, Dre -- a tiger.
Okay.
I only use the tiger when I' m fightin ', like, a dozen guys.
More than that, I use the bear.
- What' s the bear again?
- I can' t show you!
Man, that' s the secret code of the karate honor.
Hey, wait up!
- Yes?
- Sister Wilkes?
I' m Conor O' Neill.
I wanted to talk to you about --
I' m sorry.
It' s okay.
It' s just my head.
Who are you here to see?
- Sister Wilkes.
- I' m Miss Wilkes.
- Do you teach here?
- Yes.
Oh, I' m sorry.
I was just expecting... an older woman.
- Well, I' m not a nun.
- Thank God!
I mean, that' s great.
Is Kofi Evans and Raymont Bennet in your class?
Are they in my class.
Yes, they' re in my class.
I need them to play baseball for the Kekambas.
Oh, yeah.
That' s something you should take up with their mothers.
- But the kids told me -- - Both mothers agreed... the boys would read one book before they start baseball in the spring.
Hey, I got no problem with that.
You know, I think reading' s real good for kids.
You work for Smyth and Stevens Securities?
- Yes.
- What deal did you blow?
What?
Well, I' m sure you' re not coaching this team by choice.
My associate, James Fleming, is in New York for three weeks... so I volunteered to help out.
I would have loved to have coached that team.
I was away on business -- Canada -- the day Mr. Smyth and Mr. Stevens chose the team.
Canada.
That must have been nice.
Lovely.
I was in the business part the whole time though.
It' s wonderful you' re teaching these boys to play baseball.
It' s just a shame no one spends any time helping them to read.
Listen, I' m Conor.
Elizabeth.
I' m only helping out with the team for two weeks... but I' m willing to get together with you and help the boys out.
- Why don' t we exchange numbers?
- I have a better idea.
I' il give you a copy of the book the boys are supposed to be reading.
You read it, and then you can talk to them about their reports.
God.
That would be great.
Conor O' Neill, coach of the crack babies.
I can' t coach that team.
I' m serious.
I' m bailin 'out.
- How' d it go with the nuns?
- God, she was beautiful.
You picked up a nun?
Shut up.
You still want your half of the Blackhawks seats I got?
Yeah.
Where are they?
I' m gettin 'them tomorrow.
Bring 'em to the baseball field on Loomis... tomorrow between 4: 00 and 5: 00.
Loomis?
That' s the friggin 'projects!
Don' t screw me.
I' m not in the mood.
- I' il be there at 5: 00.
- Before 5: 00.
- O' Neill.
Easy, slugger, all right?
Relax.
You got some cabbage for me?
Can we talk outside, without the bat?
Duffy, you knew my dad.
And I wouldn' t be callin 'in a favor if I wasn' t completely racked.
- You smashed up my bar.
- I' il pay you.
I just need time.
It ain' t my money.
Now, I can' t carry you anymore.
I' il help with the book, take bets.
I' il bring in business.
No, that' s not gonna work.
Listen, I gave them your name because I couldn' t carry you.
What?
Are you saying some jag- off goombah is gonna come and break my thumbs?
Duffy, I' m desperate.
I' m coaching a kids' baseball team... in the projects for a guy who' s paying me 500 a week.
But I' m paying the Barber off.
What should I do?
Should I tell the Barber to back off?
Start paying you every week?
Keep payin 'the Barber... but don' t come around here unless you got the money.
I' m Pearla Evans, and this one' s Kofi.
This is my youngest, Jarius.
Everybody call me G - Baby, so --
This is my sister' s boy, Raymont.
Miss Wilkes said you' re going to help with their assignments...
- so they could play ball.
- Yeah, that was before I had this --
Miss Wilkes said she had a good feelin 'about you.
- I figured I' d give it a try.
- Miss Wilkes said that?
No.
She said she had a good feelin 'about them all playin' ball.
- But I' il tell you now, Mr. -- - O' Neill.
Conor O' Neill.
You don' t help these boys, they don' t do this work... hell will be paid with your ass.
I can reach you at Smyth and Stevens to plan a tutoring session?
- Yes.
Of course.
Anytime.
- Good.
- Go on, boys.
- Yeah, come on!
Yeah, come on, man.
I' il beat you up, man.
Yeah.
- What?
- This ain' t no giddyap show.
No, like this.
Like this.
Come on, Ticky.
You' re killin 'me.
We usually quit at 5: 30.
Mom needs me home.
- We eat around 6: 30.
- No, keep practicin '.
I' m waiting for somebody.
We' il be done soon.
- I' il let you know, Albert.
- I' m Jefferson.
Come on, man, pitch the ball!
Shut up!
- You wanna hit me?
Huh, bitch?
- Oh, shit.
And if I did, what you gonna do about it, you little punk?
Hey, that' s enough!
That' s enough, all right?
- Shit, I wanna see some blood.
- Will you guys cool it?
Practice Saturday, 1: 00, all right?
- What?
- Can I walk with you?
I' m not goin 'that way.
Sorry.
But --
Yo, what' s up, my B?
What' s up, shorty, man?
Hey, gimme that pizza, my man.
- What up, boy?
- Open the bag.
Take it!
Just let me go!
- Let go the bag, punk.
- You got it.
Let' s go!
Thanks for the bag, fool!
I think it makes you look tough.
- Is he okay?
- Who are you?
I' m the coach.
Conor O' Neill.
Why did you keep them so late?
Fool, I called you at Smyth and Stevens Securities... and at first, some little girl didn' t even know who you were.
Then some man named Fleming got on the phone... and told me you were out of the office today.
Please, take my home number.
You can' t keep them boys out there after dark.
Thank Jesus for Jefferson' s strength.
That smell?
Look at you.
You don' t even look like you' re holdin 'it together.
Jefferson, I' m sorry.
I shoulda called practice, you know, when it got dark.
I just came by because... as soon as you' re ready we expect you back, huh?
I needed to know what number uniform you wanted.
You' re never gonna stay being our coach.
Enjoy the game.
Nice wheels, soccer mom.
- Up yours.
- What' s with the wagon?
Smyth and Stevens took shit when a kid got beat up after practice... so they lent me this car to get 'em all home.
Who got beat up?
Who needs tickets?
- Jefferson Tibbs.
- That' s the fat kid, right?
Yeah -- How' d you know?
You told me about every kid on the team.
Aw, shit.
Jesus.
It' s so wrong.
How can I help you fellas?
Mister, you just sold us tickets to last night' s game.
Don' t make me shoot you!
When a man needs crack, a man needs crack!
You' re unbelievable, man.
- Need seats?
Need two?
- How we doin 'tonight?
"We"?
We aren' t doin 'so good.
San Jose' s not such a hot ticket.
- Did the Bulls cover last night?
- Yeah, they won by nine.
Shit.
I couldn' t get any action.
I need to find someone who' il take a big bet.
Fink' s minimum bet' s two grand.
- The guy at the cement plant?
- Yeah, Fink the cement guy.
Why?
- I wanna lay 12 G' s.
- 12 grand?
On what?
Since Jordan left, the Bulls have never covered at home against Miami.
- You serious about this?
- They play Miami on the 26th.
- You shouldn' t do this.
- I don' t have a choice.
Take me to meet Fink.
- Come on.
- Programs here!
Okay.
I' il take you to see Fink.
Sell some tickets.
- Who need tickets, folks?
- Who needs tickets?
- Pay up, bitch!
- I' il kick your ass, bitch!
Cool it!
Cool it!
What' s goin 'on?
All right.
Let me break it down to you right quick.
Andre say he can catch any pop - up ball anybody can throw.
Kofi say "That' s bullshit.
You a busta. "
Andre say, "Roll up, bitch."
Kofi say, "I' il give you all my gum if you catch this ball."
He threw the ball.
Andre caught it.
Andre say, "Pay me my money."
Kofi say, "You a cheatin 'bitch." No, wait.
- Kofi say, "You a motherf --" - Okay, I got it.
Thanks.
Okay, I want everybody to take a position.
Let' s go.
Let' s go.
Let' s practice.
Damn, man, you suck, just like my girlfriend.
Nice catch, Andre.
Keep chasin ', punk.
Give me the ball.
- Damn!
- What happened?
Kofi just jumped out of the way like a baby!
- What' s your problem?
- Why is everyone so quiet?
What' s up, Kofi?
You scared of the ball?
New rule!
No one can say anything bad to anyone else on the field!
Got it?
What?
You can' t talk shit you got nothin 'to say?
Let' s hear it.
- Got it.
- Got it.
Way to use your head, Jamal.
It' s cool, Jamal, man.
Don' t worry about it.
"Four Spanish men with hiking boots had surrounded me close.
I could tell they were banditos because they had taco breath... and they called me 'hombre.'
I spun around and hit the biggest one.
I punched him in the gut.
And as he was falling, he grabbed my backpack.
I said, 'Stop, you banditos!
I don' t want to have to hit anyone else. '
But because they were Spanish, they didn' t understand me.
Two more jumped me, and I hit one of them in his -- "Between his legs.
"My mouth banged on his head.
And that was where I got my fat lip.
The end. "
- So where' d you get your fat butt?
- Andre, that' s enough.
That was very nice, Jefferson.
Excellent use of the first- person narrative.
I was scared of the banditos.
It was good.
Okay, sit down.
Mr. O' Neill.
Fresh from the office?
Why don' t you invite your pants down to your shoes so they can party?
Everyone, this is Mr. O' Neill... who coaches a baseball team that some of our young men play on.
He' s taken the time out of his busy day to give us a hand.
So give him your attention.
A Wrinkle in Time is an important book... and I liked it very much.
I' m just sayin 'it ain' t like that.
Fantasy ain' t reality.
I like to read stuff that' s real.
- Give me an example.
- Michael Jordan' s book.
- Nice book, man.
- Excellent choice.
A strong piece of literature, a great read.
- Yeah.
- That' s a biography.
That' s the real story of his life.
This is fiction.
The story' s made up.
It' s meant to entertain you and make you think.
Kofi, you haven' t spoken up.
All you' ve said is you didn' t like it.
That' s right.
If you can' t say more, I' il assume that you didn' t really read it... and your mother' s gonna want me to call her.
- Did you read the book?
- Yeah.
- Tell me something about it.
Okay.
I' m gonna call your mom tonight.
That girl Meg is dumb.
She think her father comin 'back from wherever.
That' s stupid to believe in.
That girl and her mom is both trippin '.
'Cause where I' m from, don' t nobody' s father come back.
Come on, right here!
Yo, let' s do this!
I' m ready to beat 'em!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Maybe this year you could turn a double play.
Got the uniforms, Coach... and your check.
- Sorry.
Can' t.
Next time.
Good luck today.
Thanks.
Thanks for giving back to the community... dickhead.
- I want seven like last time.
- I want number four!
Find a shirt that fits and put it on, okay?
This shirt smells like my grandma.
Good to see you, Jefferson.
- Who' s got number 11?
- Coach, I got it here.
Thanks.
Jefferson, this is the biggest shirt we got, all right?
Everyone, the shirts go up in sizes from two to 11, okay?
Coach, I need a shirt.
Who' s got number ten?
- I got it.
- Give it to Jamal.
Where' s my shirt?
Hey, guys.
Guys?
Why don' t you guys play catch in the outfield, okay?
G, hang on.
Hang on.
I wanna talk to you.
- How old are you?
- I' il be nine in October.
You' re supposed to be nine before August to play in this league.
But I wanna play.
There' s only ten uniforms, 11 players.
So I gotta give the guys who are old enough first pick.
But I' m on the team, right?
Hell, yeah!
Play ball!
Strike.
He' s out!
- Strike!
- It' s all right, Ray Ray.
Strike!
Strike!
Strike!
Strike!

- Come on!

Damn!

Get down!
Get down now!
- Safe!
Oh, my God, he caught it.
Throw it!
What the hell -- Damn it!
- Okay, I' m gonna break your ass!
- What the hell is wrong with you?
Come on, baby, you can do this.
- Keep goin ', Kofi!
- Go!
Come on, Kofi!
Keep going!
Safe!
Good job.
Strike!
Out!
That' s all right.
That' s the way to take your cuts.
Good job.
- Yeah?
- Coach, I guess that' s it.
I mean, the league says we can' t start another inning after 6: 30.
- Really?
- Well, yeah.
It' s 6: 37 now, and we' re up 16 to 1.
- That' s cool.
Thanks.
- Good luck the rest of the way.
Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate?
Kekambas!
Damn, Miles, you don' t even know how to throw the ball!
Shut up, Ray Ray.
At least he ran after it when it went by.
Shit went through your legs like five damn times.
You a little punk, Dre.
Least you throw like one.
I' m tired of your shit, bitch.
- Kick his ass!
- Hey, that' s it!
That' s it!
That' s it!
- I' m gonna kill you!
- Kofi, you' re close to being done.
- I quit!
- This team sucks, man!
- Oh, hell, no.
Damn it!
- Shit!
This is you, Dre.
- This is all your fault, Dre.
Anybody hungry?
How 'bout pizza?
I' m down with that shit, my brother.
You got three large pies, 11 pops.
It' s 44. 65.
You like hockey?
Blackhawks fans?
I take the wife and kids every year to the Negro Hockey Hall of Fame.
Man, the only thing black at a Blackhawk game is the puck.
I' il give you two loge seats for the Bulls/ Mavericks on Sunday.
- For the pizza?
- For the pizza.
Done deal.
Yo, Coach!
If I get a home run next game, you gotta buy me pizza again.
Every run I score, I get one slice.
You bustas is trippin '.
Only me gettin 'pizza every game.
MVP -- Most Valuable Pizza eater.
Yo, Coach, I should be pitching.
- You wanna pitch, Miles?
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.
You can pitch on Wednesday.
- Yes!
Coach, is there any chance that we' il get trophies this year?
Let' s see.
There are eight teams in the league... play everyone twice --
We gotta win more games than we lose.
- Yes!
- So we go to the 'ship, right?
- Yeah, we could.
- Man, we goin 'to the' ship.
We goin 'to the' ship, whoa.
We goin 'to the' ship.
All right, Andre.
This is it, right?
Don' t you wanna see my house?
Sure.

Everyone' s sittin 'on the floor.
You stay below the window.

What do you do around here for fun?

We won our last game.
Miles is an amazing pitcher.
Oh, I heard.
Nine to three over the Gandas.
I' m just helping out till my colleague returns from New York.
- You' re great to take the time out.
- Hey, listen... why don' t we have dinner tonight?
What good is an expense account if you don' t pad it once in a while?
I can' t.
It' s a school night.
- Maybe some other time.
- After the game on Saturday?
- Saturday.
- The boys would love you to come.
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
You' re not really tryin 'to get Miss Wilkes, are you?
- No.
Why?
- Good.
'Cause I already tried, and she ain' t havin' it.
Do it, Jamal!
Kofi wanna come back... but first I have to "regotiate" his contract.
- Ball one!
- Okay.
- What are the terms?
- One, you tell Andre... that Kofi' s the best player.
Two, only Kofi gets pizza when he hits a home run.
Three, if he whacks it over the gate, he gets a pizza to take home.
One, when the season' s over, the team votes on who' s the best player.
Two, Kofi can have the same pizza bonuses as everyone else.
Three, if he hits it over the fence...
I' il buy him a pizza.
Okay.
Let me discuss the regotiations with my client.
Put your back into it, Jefferson!
Here!
Light this sucker up!
- Go, baby!
- One more run!
What' s up, Coach?
Kofi Evans.
- I spoke to your agent.
- I can come back?
If it' s cool with the team.
But you start shit with Andre... and you' re done -- okay?
- Run!
- You' re out!
Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate?
The Kintus!
The Kintus!
Yea, Kintus!
You' re great with them.
Thanks.
Are we on for tonight?
- Tonight?
I don' t know.
- It' s not a school night.
Come on -- just for dinner.
People can hear your screams.
I' m not sure.
Where?
It' s on the corner of Clark and Addison -- Slugger' s.
How 'bout 9: 00?
9: 00.
Clark and Addison.
- All right.
- All right?
Yeah.
Did you miss a payment with the Barber?
Yeah.
I shined him this week.
Why?
That goofy dork Gino came into Duffy' s asking for you.
Oh, Jesus.
- Ticky, this is Ed.
- Ed.
- How you doin '?
- Pleasure.
He wanted to meet you.
What do you do for money?
I' m a trader at Smyth and Stevens.
First lie.
You gonna beat me one time so you can pay off whoever else you owe?
- I wanna make a big bet.
- How big?
- Twelve grand.
- And?
And, if I win...
I wanna get paid.
No bullshit to keep bettin 'it.
This guy' s too serious.
I got a handful of clients, they lay a hundred grand a week.
- They' re not emotional about it.
- I can cover it.
Desperate.
What are you, a psychiatrist or a bookie?
Don' t you want your number?
You gonna take my bet?
- Ed, what' s the next number?
- 27.
You' re account 27 when you call in.
And your handle is?
Kekambas.
What?
Kekambas?
- Kekambas.
- Ed, you got it?
- Got it.
- You' re a strange kid, Kekambas.
I' m interested to see what happens with you.
Gino, get him.
Fuck this.
Account 27.
Kekambas.
Yeah.
What' s the line on Chicago tomorrow night against Miami?
Gimme Miami minus six.
Twelve grand.
Wait.
Wait.
I' il take Chicago and the six points.
Yeah.
Twelve thousand.
- Let' s eat.
- Okay.
Why don' t we sit?
So, I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you too.
- Do you want a drink?
- No.
What' s wrong?
I come here all the time with the guys I work with.
Look, I know you don' t work at Smyth and Stevens.
Look at you.
I could tell right away you weren' t a broker.
What' s that mean?
Nothing.
You just don' t look like you work at Smyth and Stevens.
You look like a freakin 'boring schoolteacher.
Hey, why' d you come here?
To bust me in the lie about where I work?
You win.
You coach my kids.
I thought we had a common interest.
Elizabeth, I get paid under the table to coach that team.
'cause I' m in a big hole with two bookies who are lookin' to kill me.
- What?
- Nothing.
You know all this.
I spoke to Jimmy Fleming after Jefferson got beat up.
He told me.
- You just think I' m a big joke.
- No!
You know, it' s people like me that make people like you... feel better about your tiny life.
This is unbelievable.
I can' t believe I came down here for this.
Yeah?
Then why did you come if you know I' m a liar?
Because those kids trust you.
And they don' t trust anybody.
- I told you, I coach for money.
- Well, I teach for money.
I' ve had the best fifth graders in the world, but some don' t make it.
There' s nobody besides their mother or me telling them what to do.
So what?
I' m done with all that.
Well, I just came down here to see what they see... because they' re never wrong.
Take a good look.
See what they see.
- I came to talk to you about a job.
- Yeah?
Well, unless it pays 12 grand an hour...
I' m not interested.
- Did you play it?
- Yeah.
- Twelve grand?
Yes!
- Twelve grand.
- Coach!
Can we have a word?
- How many points you givin '?
I' m getting six.
You took Chicago?
Are you on crack?
- You laid 12 grand on those -- - I' m under a lot of pressure.
- I said now!
- Win or lose, I' m outta here.
- Darryl Mackey, league' s president.
- We met.
Coach, we' re concerned about the age of some of the boys on your team.
Can you produce birth certificates for your players?
All I got is what Coach Fleming at Smyth and Stevens gave me.
Here they are.
What are the names of those two boys at second base?
- Andre and Jamal.
- Which one' s Jamal?
The taller one.
This birth certificate' s been altered.
What?
The eight' s been turned into a nine.
You have to be born after September of '88.
Well, the kid is out of the league, and the Kekambas are on probation.
Look, what are you guys -- the cops?
What' s the point of the league, Coach?
To teach kids it' s okay to lie, as long as they can get away with it?
It should be about these kids playing ball... not the trophy you bring to work.
Look, the kid goes now.
Okay?
Jefferson bats seventh, plays first base.
Miles pitches and bats eighth, and Clarence... you play third and bat ninth.
- Cool.
- Okay, let' s go.
You mad at me?
Jamal, the other coach --
'Cause I' m sorry about pushing Ray Ray.
I just want to play.
They know you changed your birth certificate.
I can' t let you play.
But my mom said it was okay.
She said that she would tell them if they asked.
She said it was okay.
- I just wanna play.
- There' s nothin 'I can do.
Look, why don' t you just sit --
Miles, do your stuff now.
Strike.
Strike!
Out.
Yeah, baby.
That' s what I' m talkin 'about.
Time, Blue.
I can' t have this kid out here with these things on.
- What now?
- We' re just all in agreement.
The kid can' t wear headphones while he pitches.
Matt makes a good point about safety.
You' re kidding me, right?
What if he gets hurt because he can' t hear in a dangerous situation?
- There' s liability issues.
- Bring it in, fellas.
- Come on, bring it in.
- What are you doing?
I want you guys to explain to them why they lost Jamal... and why Miles can' t wear headphones... and why the Bua Was and the Waatas have nice uniforms... and we have shitty T- shirts.
Easy, Coach.
You' re already on a warning.
This is the president... and that is the coach of the goofiest team in the league.
'cause he' s pitchin' too good.
It' s a safety issue.
Fellas, you understand everyone has to follow the same rules.
That' s some weak- ass bullshit, you bitch- ass, mother- freakin 'bustas.
What did you say?
I believe he said, "That is some weak- ass bullshit."
- Was that it, G- Baby?
- Yeah, that' s it.
You are on thin ice, pal!
I could have you removed from this league.
This is my last game.
I quit.
What?
I' m out.
I got business out of town.
Kekambas, back on the field.
Son, no headphones.
Coaches, get back to the dugouts.
Come on, let' s go.
Get out there.
Come on!
Let' s go!
What' d you expect?
I was gonna coach this team the whole year?
Rally, rally, the pitcher' s name is Sally!
All right, Calvin.
Big stick now.
What have you got, son?
Shit!
Hang on.
- Whatever.
I just quit.
- Finally.
- I' il see you at the game.
- Yeah.
- Slugger' s.
- Yeah.
01: 00.
Someone' s gonna be here.
Right?
I' il make sure someone' s here on Saturday for practice.
Coach, can' t you at least give us a ride?
I mean --
- It' s early.
You can walk.
- Could you drop us off?
Don' t you think I might have something more important to do... than worry about you guys and your stupid little baseball team?
Can we please go in now?
I gotta take a piss.
- We' re watching through the glass?
- I feel better out here.
All right.
He can' t get in there.
Jones fires.
Shit!
- Jones is ice cold!
- It' s all right.
Fourth quarter, we' re up by two points, you' re getting six.
- I don' t know what I' m gonna do.
- Come on.
You' re up right now.
Ride it out.
Nice play by Tillman.
He' s got it.
Here we go.
Smith throws up a prayer.
It' s good!
Holy shit!
- Should I look?
- No, no!
Not looking is working.
Keep not looking.
Oh, God, Ticky.
Am I out of the woods?
Here we go.
Miami inbounds.
Don' t foul!
Shit!
They fouled him!
Williams will shoot two!
Never again.
- Shit!
- What' s happening?
Talk to me!
What' s happening?
Williams at the line.
- Williams makes the first.
- Shit, shit!
- He makes the second, you' re dead.
- Williams shoots 80%.
Shit.
- What am I gonna do?
- Miami by seven.
Oh, my God, Ticky.
I was down 11 grand before I made this bet.
Smith dribbles inside, half- court.
Heaves a 30- footer!
It' s in!
- You covered!
Yes, it' s good!
- What' s the final score?
Miami by four!
You covered!
- You covered 12 G' s!
- I covered!
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you' s a true player
Got a gun up in your waist Please don' t shoot up the place
- That should be havin 'my baby - Baby
Hey!
You take this party somewhere else.
Kiss our ass, Duffy.
He beat Fink tonight for 12 grand!
- You got my six grand?
- Tomorrow.
Make yourself useful, huh?
- So you took Fink for 12 large.
- Yeah.
Now what?
- I don' t know.
- What do you mean, you don' t know?
We' re rolling it on the Bulls Saturday night.
I' il take that action on Ticky' s number if you wanna play it.
We covered tonight.
We got Vancouver Saturday night.
We' il cover again.
24 grand.
Yeah.
24 grand.
Then what?
Hey, you think you just won the game of life?
- What next?
- I don' t know.
If you win that, what are you gonna do with your life?
You gonna coach baseball for black kids?
I don' t know.
I don' t know, Duffy.
Maybe I' m just a loser, right?
Not like you.
Mr. Big Time, huh?
- I' m just a loser.
- All right, O' Neill.
I want my money tomorrow.
Night- night.
Time for beddy- bye, Coach.
Don' t talk down to me!
You don' t know shit about those kids!
Come on.
Let' s go, let' s go.
In a battle between two of the game' s brightest young hurlers... 21- year- old Jon Garland will face off against the red- hot Kerry Wood --
It' s Ticky.
I' m alone, I promise.
I' il take off my underwear and stand naked in your hallway to prove it.
I' m naked now.
It' s beautiful.
Come on.
I' il slide my nuts under your door till you let me in.
What' s up?
I paid Duffy.
We' re square.
Did you call Fink?
Are we down on the Bulls?
How many points?
Fink wants to see that I' ve still got his money.
Great.
Let' s go by there, flash him a little cash and bet the 12 grand.
What' s with you?
We' re gonna do this, right?
Yeah, okay.
- Jesus Christ.
I thought you quit.
- I did quit!
- I gotta drop the equipment off.
- I don' t know.
Sammy Sosa will attempt to go yard for his fifth consecutive game... and the Big Hurt will attempt to break his 11- game hitting slump.
We' re just an hour from game time.
We' il be back to take your calls.
All right.
See ya.
Hurry up, okay?
- You here to tell us you quit?
- That' s old news.
I left a message for Coach Jimmy I would drop off the equipment.
He should be here any minute.
Keep goin ', sucker.
- We goin 'to the' ship alone.
I can' t bet the 12 grand.
Fine.
I understand.
We should just bet six grand... and wait till we get breathing room --
No, I can' t.
Get your bum ass outta here, 'cause we a better team without you anyway.
I' m not listening to any of you.
I' m not listening to you or any of you!
So good luck.
Good luck on your own.
Call me when you get to the 'ship without me.
Cold.
Good luck.
I' m so glad I' m done with this.
Let' s go.
If Fink thinks we' re coming, we should at least stop by.
If we don' t want to bet it, we don' t, you know, technically --
How many of you guys been to a big league park for a baseball game?
That' s what I thought.
You guys will never be a team until you see it played right.
Never!
Gimme that.
Listen, you' re stressed out.
Let' s grab a bite.
- We can call and lay the bet.
- I' m out!
You hear me?
I' m out!
I' m out, I' m out, I' m out!
- You' re out.
- I' m done.
I' m done with all that.
Well, you gotta call Fink for me.
You can' t just dissolve a partnership like that.
I' m flapping in the breeze here.
Seriously.
I got nothin 'now.
I' m flappin 'in the breeze here.
Kekambas.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Get in the car.
Game starts in an hour.
Let' s go.
What' s this?
What are we doing?
What is happening here?
Hey, let' s -- Let' s bet three grand.
Three grand will be fine.
I mean, what' s goin 'on?
Where we -- What are we doing?
Come on, wait.
Come on.
Now wait, wait!
This is against everything that' s right!
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs!
- Second row!
- Big league right now.
We got second row!
Coach, thanks for the seats.
They hot, yo.
Yo, check it out!
That' s Sammy Sosa over there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Man, that ain' t no Sammy Sosa.
Shut up, man!
Look, y' all, look!
There' s Sammy Sosa right there!
Look!
Right there!
Yes?
Missed me.
I wanted to apologize for the other night.
I have had better dates.
Yeah.
I' m sorry.
I heard about the baseball game.
The boys loved it.
Yeah.
It worked.
We' ve won three in a row since then.
Do you have any idea how much that meant to them?
I was thinking... how the other night you knew that I wasn' t really a stock trader... and that I had a big gambling debt.
And if you were there to offer me a job... it might still stand.
So you' re not here to ask me out.
Am I supposed to be?
We need a physical activities coordinator.
- You and me?
- The school.
You know, someone to supervise after- school recess... organize games and sports.
- We' d like to get a guy because -- - I think you like me.
- What?
- I just got this gut feeling... when you were looking at me... that you like me.
Are you interested?
In the job?
What are we talking about here?
I' m interested.
I' m interested in anything I' m supposed to be interested in.
Let' s go, Bua Was!
What' s everybody lookin 'at?
Why we gotta play them damn boo- boos again, man?
They kicked our ass.
The best records in Division A play to see who goes to the 'ship.
If we win, we go to the 'ship.
If we win.
Everybody sit down.
Take a seat.
Come on, Dre.
'cause you played like a team.
I thought you should look like a team.
Jefferson Albert Tibbs...
I believe this is yours.
- Man, that shit is tight!
- Look at that!
Fellas.
- There' s no more shirts in the box.
- Nope.
What is destiny?
Destiny is you' re supposed to win.
Since you' re supposed to win, since I expect you to win... don' t you celebrate when you strike out one of these ridiculous --
Hey, dogs, hats!
What are you doing?
Sit down!
Sit down and act like champions.
Come on!
Safe!
You' re out!
Safe!
Bua Was!
Bua Was!
- Blue.
- Time!
- Good job, Clarence.
- Thanks, Coach.
Good job.
Miles.
Come on.
Listen, we' re tied two- two.
We just need to get one guy out.
Coach, I can' t pitch.
These guys are really gonna sweat me.
They' re gonna yell, and then I can' t think.
This guy is one of the best hitters in the league.
You' re in charge out here.
Okay?
Don' t rush.
Hey, you can hear "Big Poppa" in your head, right?
Yeah.
Just sometimes I lose the rhythm.
Miles, you' re great.
I' m not worried.
Rally, rally, the pitcher' s name is Sally!
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
That should be havin 'my baby, baby
Strike one.
Throw your hands in the air if you' s a true player
- That should be havin 'my baby - Two!
Strike three!
Out!
Good going, Miles.
All right.
We' re tied two- two.
- Yeah!
Last licks.
We pull this out, we goin 'to the' ship.
Leading off, we' ve got Andre, we' ve got Ray Ray, we' ve got Clarence.
After that, it' s you, Kofi, and then we' ve got Jefferson.
Let' s go to the 'ship.
- Safe!
- Way to go, Dre!
Good job.
Strike one!
Two!
Strike three!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nice job, Ray Ray.
- Damn!
- Let' s go, Kofi!
Yeah, yeah.
Almost, Kofi.
Almost.
Two down.
Jefferson, how' re you doin '?
You' re up.
Time, Blue.
We' ve got Jarius Evans batting for Jefferson Tibbs.
All right.
Wednesday night practice.
Thanks for the uniform, Coach.
- Thanks, Coach.
- See you guys later.
Hey, kid.
You can' t come in there right now.
- How long it' s gonna be?
- Don' t know.
Jamal, what' s up?
Why can' t we go in right now?
- They' re gonna cap somebody inside.
- What' re we gonna do?
Come on.
- Shit!
Come on.
- Move!
Come on, man!
- Quiet.
They' il pass by.
- Come here!
What' s up?
Shit!
- Get outta here!
Come on!
- It' s all right.
We' re okay.
G, we' re okay.
G, come on, get up.
It' s okay.
We' il just wait for somebody to come.
It' il be okay.
What?
I must
We' ve heard testimony from those very close to our community.
Praise Jesus.
I want to give a few more people the opportunity to say something on --
on Jarius' s behalf.
Please, Mr. O' Neill.
Come on up.
Good morning.
Jarius was a player on the Kekambas baseball team that I coach.
Honestly, he -- he was too young to play.
But he wanted to be a part of the team so badly that...
I couldn' t say no.
G - Baby.
You' re up.
He had a great smile too.
I know I' m not telling you anything you don' t know.
I' ve got Jarius Evans batting for Jefferson Tibbs.
He was a really tough guy.
Just a boy, really, who... wanted to be around his older brother.
Hang on, Coach.
I don' t have Jarius Evans on this roster anywhere.
Oh, you know what?
There he is.
He' s okay.
And, two outs in the last inning...
I had no choice but to let Jarius bat.
You can swing if you want, but you don' t have to.
Okay?
If you go down looking, none of us care.
But if you want to swing, swing.
Get back in there.
Do what you feel.
He was fearless as he stepped to the plate.
I was terrified for him.
With two strikes and our hopes dwindling...
he hit a shot down the first baseline...
and won the game.
And watching him... raise his arms in triumph... as he ran to first base...
I was lifted in that moment to a better place.
I swear he -- he lifted the world in that moment.
He made me... a better person... even if just for that moment.
I am... forever grateful to Jarius for that.
That was nice... what you said.
His mother was very moved.
Wait.
There' s some people who want to talk to you about the baseball team.
The team is done.
That' s what they want to talk to you about.
They' re in the auditorium.
We know the league wants to cancel the championship game.
Mom said it was all up to us' cause of G- Baby.
Yeah.
It' s over.
You guys don' t have to play.
You guys had a great year.
Wait.
You' re quitting again?
What do you mean?
We wanna play, bitch.
- You guys wanna play?
- Hell, yeah!
For G- Baby.
I' il see you tomorrow at 11: 00.
I came to make sure you guys win.
I even made a bet with your friend, Ticky.
Knowing Ticky bet against us improves our chances.
Did you really fill out an application to work at the school?
Good luck today.
Thank you.
- Andre, Ray Ray.
- What' s up, Coach?
Why don' t you bring everybody in?
- Hey, y' all, bring it in!
- Let' s go!
I want you guys to take a good look at yourselves today and feel proud.
We made it here.
We' re here.
What I' ve learned from you is that... really, one of the most important things in life... is showing up.
I' m blown away by your ability to show up... through everything that' s gone on.
The league never wanted you to play this game... but you showed up.
But we only have eight players, so --
- God.
- We can' t play.
He was my brother.
He loved to watch us play.
He' s watching us right now.
We gonna play today.
Here you go, Kofi.
- Okay, this is for G- Baby.
- G- Baby.
I wrote it all down:
4, 222 square feet, four floors. perfect.
Courtyard in back, south- facing garden.
Perfect.
- Shouldn' t we wait for the car service?
- No, we' il sit in traffic forever.
- Is that the listing sheet?
- There isn' t one.
It' il be gone soon.
- None.
You know the market is tight.
- Mom, we' re in the street.
Evan!
One day you will learn to respect people' s time, Lydia.
You' il realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience.
I' m so sorry.
I' m meeting Arthur Digby Laurence in 26 minutes...... and if you think he' s the kind of man who tolerates tardiness...... you are sadly mistaken.
You' re a saint to wait for us.
- Hello.
It' s kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone.
We call it a "townstone".
Built in 1879, this is the middle of the house, the parlor floor.
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...... which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities.
Sarah.
There are two bedroom floors above.
My God, it' s amazing.
Hey, kid.
No scooter.
I don' t have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.
It' s got a yard.
Sort of.
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again, 21- foot lot, 53 deep.
It allows for an expansive garden.
Working elevator.
The previous owner was disabled the last years of his life.
Highly unusual, the elevator.
You will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones.
Perhaps it' s something of a fixer- upper, but we anticipate enormous interest.
It' s a very emotional property.
Shall we have a look at the rest?
You should make an offer immediately.
Can I see it first?
There is nothing like this on the market right now.
You can' t move from Greenwich to the Upper West Side...... and expect to still have a house, a yard and a dog and cat, but here it is.
It' s got everything you told me you wanted and more.
You' il have another family.
You could have two.
It' s a fortune.
You don' t have to pay the price on the tag.
He can afford it.
It would be so lovely if I could show the property before I leave.
Hardwood floors throughout, as many as six working fireplaces.
This is the top floor.
Two bedrooms.
One at either end.
They share one small bath.
Originally, this would have been the servants' quarters.
The previous owner kept a small nursing staff.
I don' t know if you have live- in help.
No, it' s just the two of us.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, or what have you.
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.
He' s talking about Sidney Pearlstine, the financier.
May I ask what you do, Mrs....
Altman.
Actually, I' m going back to school.
Columbia.
Her husband' s in pharmaceuticals.
I didn' t realize you were Stephan Altman' s wife.
Yes, until recently.
Master bath.
Pearlstine' s been in all the papers since he died.
He was a recluse.
Rich, paranoid.
Now they can' t find half his money.
I hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property.
It sounds ridiculous.
Walk- in closet.
Could the little one please stop that?
Kid, no elevator!
And we emerge in the master suite.
What?
Is this room smaller than it should be?
You' re the first person to notice.
On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.
It' s called a panic room.
- A safe room.
- A castle keep in medieval times.
- I' ve read about these.
They' re in vogue in high- end construction.
One can' t be too careful about home invasion.
This is perfect.
The alarm goes off in the middle of the night.
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?
I think not.
Concrete walls.
Buried phone line, not connected to the house' s main line.
You have your own ventilation system.
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house.
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
No, but I loved her last album.
Steel.
Thick steel.
Very thick steel.
Full battery backup, so even if the power' s out...... it' s still functional.
Open it, please.
And with kids like he' s apparently got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Please open the door.
That is highly inappropriate.
Open the door, please.
Definitely my room.
This is really dangerous.
- Not at all.
Motion detector, like an elevator.
There' s another one at your ankles.
It couldn' t be safer.
I know they' il take asking price.
I hooked up the phone!
Good for you, Mom.
Hooked up a phone.
579 what?
3000.
patsy' s pizza. please hold.
Hey.
Enough.
Mind the pizza?
What do you mean?
Our first night.
I should' ve thought of something special.
I like pizza.
Fuck him.
Don' t.
Fuck her, too.
I agree.
But don' t.
Don' t you think this place has way too many stairs?
You didn' t carry anything up them.
You never asked what I thought of this house.
I didn' t want you to tell me you hated it.
- Well, so did l.
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase.
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.
Go ahead.
Oh, damn.
I forgot to set up that tour of your new school.
Dad already did it.
I' m going with him on Sunday.
Oh, yeah?
So I' il take a cab and meet him there.
Is that what he said?
You don' t have to drive me everywhere?
I' il ride with you.
Why' d you bring me here if I can' t go anywhere on my own?
That' s it.
I quit.
I' m not fighting with you till tomorrow.
Come here.
It' s disgusting how much I love you.
Tell me about it.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
It' s too dark.
Better?
That' s better.
"Bypass non- ready zone".
"Bypass non- ready zone".
"Shunt.
Enter ".
"Bypass non- ready zone".
"Shunt".
"Enter zone number".
"Shunt again".
In the morning I got to figure out how to turn this thing off.
Go, go back.
Do it.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Amateur.
We got a problem!
We need to talk!
It' s about time.
I' m freezing my tits off out there.
- Who is that?
- This is Raoul.
Who the fuck is Raoul?
Raoul is okay.
Raoul has experience.
- Through some people.
Open the fucking door.
No shit.
What is this?
They' re asleep.
They' re not supposed to be here.
- This is your department, Junior!
Videotape.
We' re on videotape.
We' ve been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs.
- 14- day escrow.
- You fucked me!
14- day escrow!
That' s almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?
Escrow is always business days.
Five- day weeks always!
Right?
I' m out of here.
Just wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?
It' s just a woman and a kid?
- Unless Daddy comes home.
- He' s not.
They' re divorcing.
Daddy' s banging some B model on the Upper East Side.
It' s just her and the kid!
Now, can we do this?
Yeah, we can do it.
Not with people here.
And not with me.
- Wait!
- She' il call the police.
They' il be here before I unpack my bags.
So, we keep an eye on her.
Raoul can totally administrate that part.
I don' t want Raoul to administrate that!
He' s not even supposed to be here!
Nobody gets hurt.
What about us?
What if she has a gun?
Who are you?
I' m Raoul.
You know we can' t do this without you!
Fuck that!
This is a great plan.
It' s just got a slight twist.
Yeah.
Thirty years.
You make a lot of promises, don' t you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.
You' re right.
It' s all fucked up.
I fucked it up!
It' s not how it' s supposed to be.
But the fact of the matter is there' s still $3, 000, 000 in this house...... and no one but you and I even knows it' s here.
I want it!
But you...... you need that money.
Or have you forgotten why you' re here?
So let' s quit dicking around, okay, and get this over with.
Kill the phones.
Give me that!
You stay here!
Nobody gets past!
Sarah!
Get up!
What did you do that for?
Where are you going?
- People.
In the house.
They' re in the elevator, heading down.
Fuck!
I told you.
I don' t hurt people.
They' re going downstairs.
- What?
The panic room.
No, press emergency stop.
Fuck!
Coming back up!
That' s you.
Shit.
Go!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Mother -
Shit!
That' s seven years bad luck.
Shit.
Tell me they' re not in there.
Oh, damn.
- It doesn' t work?
- It' s a different phone line.
I never hooked it up.
Now what?
I can' t hear a thing.
What do you think they want?
I don' t know.
Rob us....
I don' t know.
What do we do?
We wait.
- Well, they can' t.
It' s not possible.
Mom.
I heard you.
- Do you feel okay?
- Yeah.
- You shaky?
- No.
- No.
Don' t worry about me.
He' s got kids.
What do you think he' il do?
Use your head.
Here he comes.
She' s not getting down from there.
- Good.
- She could be in there calling the cops.
Could she have hooked it up today?
No.
You don' t just call up Bell Atlantic.
She would' ve had to do it through Manhattan Security, my company.
You see?
She couldn' t have.
- I thought she wouldn' t be here.
Fuck you!
She is not supposed -
Do it.
Excuse me.
The police are on their way.
- You' re full of -
It' s a PA system.
I know.
I' m just scaring her.
I suggest you leave before they get here.
- He' s saying that we don' t have a phone.
How could he know that?
Take what you want and get outI
If only it were that easy.
Give me some paper.
You going to help us out?
You got a piece of paper?
- I don' t know.
"What we want is in that room"?
No, no.
I told you.
They can' t get in here.
What do you know about this room?
What do we know about that room?
- Just a few details.
We' re not coming out, and we' re not letting you in!
Get out of my houseI
- You fuck.
- What?
"Get the fuck out of my house".
Get the fuck out of my houseI
Okay, I have an idea.
She' s a woman.
Women need security.
She won' t believe you.
She needs to know she' s dealing with decent people and she can trust us.
Conversation' s overI
What?
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?
Like that' il help you think.
Fine!
You think!
- What if she did call the cops?
She said it again, that she called the cops.
Okay, fine.
Good, excellent.
We all believe you.
How do we get into that room?
What is funny about this?
Is this shit funny to you?
I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...... to keep out people like us.
It' s all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?
We can' t.
You can' t get in the panic room.
That' s the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.
And why would she do that?
I don' t know.
But when she does, she can' t get out of this house.
We keep her here, we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...... and I don' t want any help from Joe Pesci over here.
They want to hole up in this house?
Fine.
We make it impossible for them to leave.
And why would they come out in the first place?
I' m working on that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I' m okay.
- I know.
- I mean it.
- I won' t.
You know, people never get buried alive anymore.
I guess it used to happen all the time.
Really?
Yeah, I read that.
And when did this happen all the time?
Twenty, thirty years ago.
What are they doing now?
I don' t know.
They' re locking us in.
This is not happening.
Sarah, calm down.
You know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up.
- What the hell are you doing?
No, you' re not.
Even if you got through the concrete, there' s steel.
We' il see.
This is what I do.
If some idiot with a sledgehammer could break in...... do you really think that I would still have a job?
Don' t get that in your eye.
Neighbor.
Help!
Please help us!
- Do you hear us?
Help us!
Help!
- Help us, please!
- Call the police!
Shit!
You guys just going to stand there?
What do you got, MacGyver?
He can' t get in here with a hammer, can he?
Could you be any louder?
Give me a hand with those boxes.
Listen, goddamn it!
I' m in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?
- They' re going to get in here.
- No, they can' t get in here.
We' re going to be fine.
We' il be just fine.
Oh, this is good.
This could work.
I was just thinking that we should do something like this.
- Open it.
- I just did.
Open it some more.
We' re just sending them a message.
They' il get the point.
Honey, get down on the ground.
- Don' t be stupid.
- Quiet!
We' re trying to scare them, not kill them.
What is it?
It' s bad.
They' re coughing.
If they' re coughing, they' re going to die!
Nobody is going to die, man!
Will you please have the balls to follow through with something?
Mom.
They' il have a hangover.
How are we going to get in there if they pass out, Junior?
Cut it back a little.
They won' t pass out, numb- nuts.
They' il throw up first.
We can' t get in if they' re dead!
Stay on the ground and breathe.
Turn it down.
Turn it down!
It' s too much!
- Keep it down!
I' m turning it down.
- We' re not killing anybody.
- Turn the shit off.
- No.
- Turn it down.
- Just a second.
Get under this.
Oh, my god.
- Fucking amateurs, man!
- It' s my fucking idea.
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.
What is that?
Turn the gas off.
Turn the gas off right now.
Get back!
Shit!
God!
Get it off me!
It' s okay.
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!
I' m coming in there!
Calm the fuck down.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Promise me you' il never do anything like that.
I won' t.
At least they' re still moving in there.
What?
Talk to him.
Please, man, give it a rest.
- That Morse code?
- SOS.
Where' d you learn that?
Titanic.
We got to talk.
Downstairs.
No, no, no.
Not you.
Come on, come on, come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Wake up.
The first thing I' m going to do this morning is call my plastic surgeon.
There' s been a change here. $100, 000 is not enough.
Not for this shit.
I want a third of whatever' s in that room up there.
Okay?
Full share, one- third.
Congratulations.
You bought a ski mask, made $1, 000, 000.
Your parents will be proud.
Got him.
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.
I' m not losing my half of the money because -
Slow down.
Half?
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....
Come on.
I' m letting you know he' s a problem.
But this wasn' t my idea, so he' s your problem.
You' re right.
It wasn' t your idea!
It was my idea!
Come on, look over here.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Let' s hope this guy' s an ex- Boy Scout.
- We' re here!
- Help us!
We' re over here!
Help!
Open your window!
Help!
We' re never going to get out of here.
I' m the loving grandson who put in the time with the old man...... every goddamn weekend for two years...... talking to him, dressing him, walking him, feeding him.
No.
I' m the one the old man finally told about the safe.
I' m the one who found the guy who built it, and I convinced him to break into it!
Wait a minute.
- What?
- The bedroom' s empty.
Where are they?
Two of them, on the stairs.
Where' s the third guy?
I left my cell phone by the bed.
I earned that money.
I will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan...... because you have a problem relating to others!
Got it?
If I don' t come back, close this door.
Just do what I say.
He touches me again, I' il shoot him.
Christ!
Wait!
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle, or can we get back to work?
Don' t take no tone with me, jerk- wad.
I' il shove it up your ass and snap it off.
You' re a bus driver, Raoul.
You live in Flatbush.
Don' t spout some Elmore Leonard bullshit you just heard...... because I saw that movie, too.
What is this?
I got some news for you.
Go.
Go!
Fuck!
What did she get?
No.
Charger!
She has a cell phone.
No!
All right, signal.
Signal.
I don' t think they' il be talking on no cell phone from in there.
- Why not?
- You can' t call out from in there.
No signal.
I didn' t hook up this line, but I hooked up the main line.
If we can find it, we can cut into it.
I can' t go to prison, man.
I' m not built for that shit.
Be careful.
Get the phone.
- Rip it off!
Phillips.
Junior, when I asked you to cut the phone lines, did you cut the main line?
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen?
Shit!
Strip this and expose the wires.
- I have no idea.
- Okay, got it?
Here.
Okay.
Yellow, yellow.
Okay.
Dial tone.
911 emergency.
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street -
- please hold.
God.
Call Dad.
How do you live in New York and not have a single Percocet?
- Stephan.
Put Stephan on the line.
- It' s Meg.
Do you know what time it is?
- Put him on the phone, bitch.
- It' s your fucking wife.
Move.
- Hello?
- You' ve got to help us.
Move!
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in -
What -
- He' il do something.
- No, he won' t.
He' il call the police.
You don' t know her.
She won' t let him.
No.
He knows that there' s trouble.
He' s across the park.
That' s why we got houses close to each other.
Just in case we needed each other.
He' il help us.
- He won' t.
- Yes, he will!
I' m sorry.
No, I' m sorry.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you.
What?
I' m dizzy and hungry.
All she' s got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.
Looks like that gas idea didn' t work so well.
Whose fault was that?
This is impossible.
What' s the plan now, hot rod?
This is unpleasant.
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood- sugar up.
Can you hear me okay?
I' m just dizzy, not deaf.
Smart ass.
That' s excellent.
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?
Let' s check it again.
Mom, I did it.
We got to stay calm, okay?
All right?
Stay calm.
You' re making me nervous.
I' m sorry.
What if I keep dropping?
You won' t.
I' il figure something out.
You know, he' s right.
There' s no way we' re getting into that room.
What are you talking about?
I just got to be honest with myself here.
I don' t need to be involved...... with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life.
- You' re giving up?
- Hell, yes.
I don' t need the fucking aggravation.
I' il make an anonymous phone call.
They' il find the floor safe.
I' il inherit.
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.
Fuck, I' il still put away 8 or 900 grand and keep my goddamn hair.
Take it.
Go out and get loaded.
Wait a minute.
Say what you just said again.
Say that shit about the money again, babycakes.
Before?
Yeah, before.
Splitting the money in your head, you said you' d put away 800 or 900 grand.
What are you doing?
That was after tax, which makes it more than a million and a half gross.
So now you' re a tax attorney.
- I' m out of here.
- Wait a minute.
There' s sugar in everything.
Places you' d never expect.
Like ketchup.
Where else?
Travel kit.
Plus, you named eight people you got to split it with...... so that' s 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe.
A fuck- up like you has got to get less than everybody else...... so now I don' t know what to think.
You' re adding up money you' il never touch, buddy.
How much is in there?
Mouthwash.
Saccharin.
Hey, I' m talking to you.
Answer me.
Fine.
There' s more.
And when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail?
It' s totally fucking moot!
- Why are we having this conversation?
- What were you thinking?
How did you expect to get away with this?
Did you think that I' d open that safe...... and then me and Raoul would wait while you picked out your share?
What' s the matter with you?
You got us into this mess, and you were going to fuck us?
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.
Your eyes were huge when I told you about the gig...... so don' t play innocent.
Things didn' t work out.
Play past it.
Sugar- free.
Mints?
Sugar- free.
I' m opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.
It' s looking doubtful there, big guy.
I will split the money with Raoul.
But I don' t ever want to see you again.
Cops show up on my doorstep, we will know who sent them...... and we will fucking find you.
I' il see you, Burnham.
Later, Raoul.
Mom!
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street a couple of times...... think you know all about it.
You don' t know nothing about me.
Shut your eyes and don' t turn around.
Okay.
You should see the look on your face.
What' s happening?
- Don' t move.
Don' t you fucking move.
- No, don' t.
Come here.
Come here.
- Don' t shoot, please.
- Come on.
Shut it, lock it and get the fuck away from it.
- Stop it, you fucking - - Fucking what?
Idiot?
Fucking asshole?
Who' s the clown now?
Me.
That' s right.
It' s burning me.
Who' s got the gun?
You.
Remember that.
Find out who the fuck that is.
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet.
Stephan Altman.
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?
What did she say?
Don' t know.
- Did you call anybody else?
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?
No.
He' s telling the truth.
Yeah.
Yeah, he probably is.
Because when I do this, people don' t lie.
What?
- What do you want?
- Get us into that room.
- Yeah, you can.
You' re full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.
You want me to just make something up?
You' ve got till the count of three.
Then you end up like Junior over there.
- One, squeeze.
- This is ridiculous.
Two, squeeze.
I don' t know what to tell you.
- Three.
Okay.
I got an idea.
Maybe.
Maybe.
HelpI Rubber Soul...... Yesterday and Today, MagicaI Mystery Tour, The White Album....
Stay warm, all right?
Let It Be, Revolver, Sgt. pepper....
Oh, god!
Dad?
No, no.
Take it easy.
Open the door!
Open the door!
No.
Don' t open the door!
- Don' t you tell me what -
Open the door!
Don' t open -
Knock it off!
You kill him, they' il never open that door.
Oh, god.
All right.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Lie down.
All right.
You' il be fine.
Come on.
He' s fucking crazy.
Get your hands off him, you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!
You' re a strong girl.
Be strong, sweetheart.
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!
It' s almost over.
Yeah, that' s it.
That' s it.
All right, turn around.
I' il be right back.
It' s got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.
Get your tapes.
Who' s this?
It' s her kid.
What happened to her?
Who gives a fuck?
Hurry up.
Get your stuff.
Hey, lady.
Mom?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
We' ve got your kid.
Come down here.
Let' s get this over with.
Get her, get her!
Shit!
What happened?
No!
Let her out!
- Where' s your gun?
- Open the door.
No!
- I don' t know.
Open up!
Open it.
Listen to me.
She' s got your gun.
She' s got your gun!
Stop screaming.
Stop it.
I know you' ve got the gun. put the gun down and step away from the door.
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.
She needs an injection.
Do you hear me?
Open the door so I can give her a shot.
Or I swear to God, I' il kill you both.
If I open the door, you' il shoot us.
So give her the shot yourself.
Give her the shotI
Do you need this?
Can you do this yourself?
What happens if you don' t get it?
Coma.
Die.
Open it.
put the gun on the floor.
And go all the way downstairs.
And I' il give her the shot, all right?
I told you to leave the gunI
Shit.
You fucking bitchI
If you pull any shit like that again, I will fucking kill her.
Do you hear me?
If you step outside, I' il kill her!
If I see a uniform inside this house, I' il cut her fucking throatI
Do you understand?
Yes.
But please, just give her the shot.
Please.
please.
Don' t fucking do it.
While we' re in here, she' il call the cops.
Are you going to open the safe?
Don' t you look at me.
All I know about this is what I see on TV.
You got to talk me through this.
This right here?
It' s this?
Yeah, okay.
Nice house you guys got.
Your mom' s rich.
Dad' s rich.
Mom' s just mad.
Tap it.
I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this.
It' s not that I didn' t try.
Sometimes things, they don' t work out the way you want them to.
Done.
Wasn' t supposed to be like this.
He had it all worked out.
Nobody was supposed to even be here.
Thanks...... Burnham.
Wasn' t supposed to be like this.
She' s going to be okay.
I gave her the shot.
She' s all right.
It' il be over soon.
Stephan.
Oh, my god.
Can you move?
Not much.
I think my arm is broken.
Raise your arm.
Come on, raise your arm.
Try again.
Come on.
Try again.
Meg, please don' t do anything stupid.
They' re going to kill us.
Just do everything they ask.
It' il be okay that way.
Stephan, they' il kill her.
Holy shit.
She called the goddamn cops.
The police.
You called the police?
Of course, I called them.
You scared the shit out of me.
She killed the kid.
She just killed her own kid.
All right, take this.
Don' t say a word.
No, her husband must have called them.
Foreign son of a bitch.
I told you!
Where is she?
There.
What the fuck' s she doing?
She' s going to handle it.
I' m just trying to unlock....
- Is everything okay?
- You all right, ma' am?
What are you....
What time is it?
It' s a little after 4: 00 a. m.
We got a call, ma' am.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
- No, you can' t come in.
Ma' am, you sure you' re all right?
I' m fine.
Ma' am, you don' t look so good.
Well, you don' t look so hot yourself, Officer Keeney.
Come on, I' m freezing out here.
"There are three".
What?
Your husband said you called for help.
That you said, "There are three" right before you got cut off.
Oh, that phone call.
And your neighbors...... called in about some loud shouts or a loudspeaker of some kind?
That was the TV.
It' s off now.
Can I just ask you one question?
What was the end of that sentence?
When you said, "There are three"...... what was the rest?
Look....
My husband and I just split up...... and it' s my first night in a new house...... and I admit I was a little drunk.
And the sentence, if you insist on knowing...... was going to be:
"There are three things that I' il do for you if you come jump into bed with me".
Unless, of course...... two policemen came in the middle of the night and interrogated me.
So, Rick, you want to go?
Or do you want her to tell you which three things?
All right.
Ma' am...
... if there' s something you want to say to us...... but maybe you can' t say it right now...... you might want to make some kind of a signal...... by blinking your eyes a few times.
Something like that.
That' s something you could do safely.
Man...... you guys are good.
You mean, like if there was somebody in the house or something?
They really train you guys.
No, I' m fine.
I' m fine.
Cross my heart.
Sorry to disturb you, ma' am.
'Night, ma' am.
This kid has seen my face.
Yeah, well, that' s not my problem.
Yeah, it is.
You' re here with me.
You' re on the hook, too.
Same price for the rest.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You know how this is going to end.
Goddamn!
What' s up?
Why the hell didn' t we do that?
What' s she doing?
What the fuck does she think she' s doing?
She' s got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?
Just let me drill, man.
Empty?
Come on, man.
Bank bonds.
One second.
Two, three, four, five....
Why are we doing this?
Because it' s going to come to that.
There are 22.
22 million dollars.
That lying little shit!
Let' s get out of here.
Lift.
Leave that.
Christ, I' il buy you new tools.
You' il be okay.
It' s glass.
I got you.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Watch the glass.
Get down here.
Wait.
Wait.
You don' t want to do that.
Dad, don' t shoot him!
Let my daughter go.
We' re finished.
Your daughter' s fine.
You' il never see us again.
Let her go.
Okay.
It' s okay.
Let' s go.
Let' s go.
Just let her go.
Let her go.
Let go of her!
Put that gun down.
- Sarah, come here.
- Put that gun down!
- Don' t be crazy, man.
- Just let her go.
- Let her go!
Are you okay?
- Did they hurt you?
- No.
- Did they touch you?
- No.
Stephan, shoot him.
Shoot him!
Get off her!
You' il be okay now.
- Police!
- Don' t move!
- Nobody move!
- Everybody on the ground!
Team two, upstairs.
Team three, down.
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Freeze!
Don' t move, motherfucker!
Don' t move!
I will kill you!
Move away from the wall!
Get off the fence!
Move!
Put your hands in the air!
It' il be okay.
It' s fine, Dad.
Is there anybody else in the house?
No.
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.
It' s okay.
I' m all right.
I want to see the palms of your hands!
Do you hear me?
Open your hands!
Dad, it' s okay.
You' re going to be fine.
Everything is going to be fine.
This sounds interesting.
"Two- bedroom with den or third bedroom...

I thought you liked the West Side.
"61st and Central Park West.

- What' s that?
- It' s French for "superintendent".
What' s W. E. A. mean?
That' s West End Avenue.
"81st and West End Avenue.

Do we need all that space?
How about this?

Turn to your right.
That' s it, sir.
Please follow the orange line.
We processed the roll of film we found in your bag, Mr. Parrish.
They' re not very pretty pictures.
Also, you left the camera in the hotel.
We processed that roll as well.
Can I see them?
That' s not a courtesy, Mr. Parrish.
This is evidence.
Do you guys have your own lab... or do you have to send it out?
We have a lab.
Your legal aide should be here within 30 minutes or so.
Now you understand you don' t have to talk to me until she gets here if you don' t want to.
You know that, Sy?
- Good.
Sy, can I ask you one question?
Sure.
What was it about William Yorkin that upset you so?
I mean, what did he do to provoke all of this?
Family photos depict smiling faces...
Happy birthday!
Children' s birthday parties.
People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives.
Someone looking through our photo album would conclude that we had led a joyous, leisurely existence... free of tragedy.
No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget.
Hey, we' re gonna go.
Sure you don' t need my help?
Yeah.
I gotta work.
Doesn' t matter.
I' m gonna get some takeout for dinner, okay?
Okay.
- See ya.
Jake, are you coming or what?
I' m coming!
There' s one.
Okay.
Mom, can I check out the toys?
I' m just dropping off some film.
Make sure you can see me, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Mrs. Yorkin.
Hey, Yoshi.
How are you?
How have you been?
We' re doin 'good, thanks.
- Got 3 rolls today.
- Okay.
Can I get that address again?
Yes, it' s 3 -- 326 Serrano Terrace, Yoshi.
I' il take care of Mrs. Yorkin.
What have we got today?
I' ve got one in here as well.
And can I have 2 prints of each, please?
Leica Mini- Lux.
That' s a very nice camera.
- Really?
Because Will' s been trying to get me to go digital --
Oh, don' t do that.
I' d be out of a job.
You have one shot left.
Oh, that' s okay.
Oh, it' s a shame to waste it.
Oh, no, really, it' s fine.
I look horrible.
How' s Jake doing?
Oh, he' s great.
Oh.
How old is he, 9?
That' s right.
He just turned 9.
- 9.
Hmm.
Thanks.
When do you need these by?
Oh.
You know, we close at 7: 00 on Sundays.
I can -- I can swing by tomorrow.
Mrs. Yorkin, you' re one of our best customers.
I' il have 'em for you by the time we close.
Thank you so much.
No problem.
I' il go get some shopping done.
We' il see you in 40 minutes.
Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey, Jake.
You sliced through an exposure on that last roll, Sy.
I made a mistake.
Mrs. Levitt has a problem... offer her a free roll of film.
All right.
I' ve been doing P. O. S. mini- lab work for over 20 years now.
I consider it an important job.
When people' s houses are on fire... what' s the first thing they save after their pets and their loved ones are safe?
The family photos.
Some people think that this is a job for a clerk.
They actually believe that any idiot that attends a 2- day seminar can master the art of making beautiful prints in less than an hour.
But of course, like most things... there' s far more to it than meets the eye.
I' ve seen the prints they fob off on people at the Rexall or Fotek.
Milky, washed out prints.
Too dark prints.
There' s no sense of reverence for the service they' re providing for people.
I process these photos as if they were my own.
I see someone had quite a birthday party.
I did them 5x7 for you.
Um, the larger ones are better.
I didn' t charge you extra for them.
Okay, um... it' s okay, I guess.
How much do I owe you, Sy?
Uh, 30. 06, but let' s just call it an even 30.
All right, thanks.
You know, we have a special gift for birthday boys.
Really?
That' s right.
Birthday boys get a free camera.
Thanks.
You' re welcome, buddy.
We' re taking Jake to Six Flags this weekend, so...
I' il see you very soon.
See you.
- Come on, Jake.
See ya, Jake.
Yeah.
Good night, A. J.
Oh, look at this.
This is a great shot.
- I remember that.
Oh, you guys are so cute.
Ah.
Okay, this one' s going into the trash.
Oh, yeah.
Look at your face.
That' s a classic.
No, you' re not getting it back.
Will, I' m serious.
Better give it to her.
She' s serious.
Told you.
Hey, how' d this one get in here?
- Oh, that' s Sy.
Sy, the photo guy.
Sy took it to finish off the roll.
I get you anything else, Sy?
Just the check' s fine.
What you got there, family photos?
Yeah.
You mind if I take a look?
Mmm, these are beautiful.
That' s a good shot.
Yes.
That' s my little nephew, Jake.
He' s a handsome boy.
Isn' t he?
Oh.
Well, you must be his favorite uncle then.
I don' t know.
Sure I can' t get you no more coffee then?
I' m fine, thanks.
Have a nice night now.
You, too.
Mom?
What, pookie?
I feel bad for someone.
Somebody at school?
No.
What do you mean, you feel bad?
When someone seems sad... they don' t have any friends... and people make fun of' em... that makes me feel bad for them.
Who is sad and doesn' t have any friends?
Sy.
Sy?
The photo guy at the one hour place?
Yeah.
Oh, Jake.
I really feel bad for him.
But Jake... we don' t know that Sy is sad.
We really don' t know that much about him, you know?
I mean, he might even have a lot of friends.
He probably has a girlfriend and -- and a mommy and a daddy who love him.
Oh.
That is so sweet of you to think of somebody else like that, you know?
Listen, Jake... not everybody is as lucky as we are.
But maybe if we send them good thoughts... we' il make them feel better.
Okay.
Okay?
All right?
Ready?
Yeah.
There.
I bet the next time we see Sy... he won' t seem so sad.
Okay.
You have to go to sleep, pookie.
Okay.
I love you.
Good night.
There you go.
Come on.
How -- How do you think we pay for all this?
I' m just asking you.
What do you think... there' s a money fairy that comes and slips an envelope under my pillow every month?
What are you even talkin 'about?
Well -- Well, how -- All of this stuff... the new Mercedes, the matching washer and dryer... the fucking Jil Sander blouse you have on now -- how?
I love you, Nina.
I' ve gotta work to make that happen.
Do you even believe what you' re saying, huh?
This is not about things, Will... and it' s not about money.
You' re neglectful.
Do you understand that?
What?
You are an emotionally neglectful husband... and you' re an emotionally neglectful father.
Got it now?
Neglectful?
You' re not here, Will.
You' re not here.
You' re never here.
I' m going to bed.
Oh, my God!
Someone' s trying to kill me!
It' s for Bart.
But who' d wanna hurt me?
I' m this century' s Dennis the Menace.
It' s probably the person you least suspect.
That' s good, Dad.
Monday is our busiest day.
People tend to shoot most of their pictures on weekends.
The store has several regular customers.
There' s Mrs. Von Unwerth who only takes pictures of her cats.
I' ve never seen a picture of a human being.
Just cats.
2 copies, please, Mr. Parrish.
There' s Mr. Siskind.
Mr. Siskind is an insurance claims adjuster.
He only brings in pictures of wrecked cars.
The usual, Sy.
I need these by 3: 00.
We get all the new parents which, in this neighborhood... makes up a big part of our business.
New parents go photo crazy.
I don' t know how many rolls I have here.
Cindy, a nurse from a nearby cosmetic surgery clinic is a regular customer.
We do all of Dr. Fried' s before and after shots.
Oh, thanks, Sy.
Then there' s the amateur porn artists.
We have to report kiddie porn and animal cruelty... but anything else, no questions asked.
Plus point 3?
Sy, are you fuckin 'kiddin' me?
Nobody gives a shit until those shifts are in the double digits.
It' s blue, Larry.
Well, I bet Brandt cares about a plus point 3.
Are you fuckin 'threatening me?
You' re breakin 'my balls over a plus 3 blue shift.
Fuckin 'asshole.
Next time you call me out here... that thing better be belching fire.
That' s a great attitude, Larry.
Thanks for your precision work.
What the hell you doin '?
Excuse me?
What was the deal with you and the AGFA guy?
Well, Bill, I' m trying to preserve a minimum level of quality for my customers.
Your customers.
And he seems to think that a plus point 3 shift to cyan is insignificant.
Sy, let me try and explain something to you one more time.
You need to take another look at your place on the food chain.
They' re SavMart' s customers.
If you haven' t noticed, this isn' t Neiman Marcus.
People just wanna come in here with their kids... have a good time, and save a few pennies on paper towels and socks.
If they wanted to see yelling and screaming... they' d stay at home.
It was wrong of me to create a scene in front of all those customers, Bill.
It won' t happen again.
Sy, don' t you have some vacation time saved up?
I guess I probably do.
You should take some time off.
Go down to a Club Med.
You know, relax.
Lay in the sun.
Enjoy life.
Well, I' il think about that, Bill.
And Sy, your lunch break was up 1/ 2 an hour ago, man.
What the hell you been doin 'in here?
I' m trying to figure out if this will work with my Mac.
This isn' t my section.
Yeah.
Sy Parrish.
I' m the photo tech here.
I do all your family' s pictures.
Sy.
Sy, the photo guy.
Here you are in the fesh.
Yeah.
I don' t see you in here too often.
Nina usually does most of the shopping.
Um, can you help me with this?
Well, I wish I could, but this is computers... and I do photo finishing.
It' s not my section.
I' m actually in just a little bit of a rush.
I had one question I needed answered.
Oh, no problem.
I' il get, uh, I' il get someone.
Customer assistance, aisle 4.
Someone will be here in just a minute.
You got it.
So is the rest of the family here?
Uh, Jake' s around here somewhere.
You' re a very lucky man, Mr. Yorkin.
I' m sorry?
You have a wonderful family... and if you don' t mind my saying so... a very beautiful house, too.
Well, thank you, Sy, I, uh... appreciate that... but l -- you know, I really need to get all this stuff and get the hell outta here.
Hey, I understand.
Thanks for all your help, though.
Oh, it' s okay.
You say hello for me.
I will do.
Well, I gotta be gettin 'back.
There' il be someone here in just --
There you go.
Oh, uh, great.
You know, it doesn' t say here if this will work for the Mac or not.
We have some Mac- based stuff down here.
- Jake.
- Hi.
I was just talking to your dad.
What do you have there?
Oh.
Wow.
What does he do?
Well, he' s a good guy.
He can fy, and he has a silver sword that can kill bad guys.
Really?
Yeah, and he' s 60 feet tall.
And you really want this, don' t you?
Yeah, well --
Jake.
We' re leaving.
I gotta go.
Well, I' il put this back for you, okay?
See ya later.
I told you not to talk to strangers.
I' m sure my customers never think about it... but these snapshots are their little stands against the fow of time.
The shutter is clicked... the fash goes off... and they' ve stopped time... if just for the blink of an eye.
"I was here.
"I existed.
"and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture."
How much for this one?
Most people don' t take snapshots of the little things... the used Band- Aid... the guy at the gas station... the wasp on the Jell- O... but these are the things that make up the true picture of our lives.
People don' t take pictures of these things.
Aw, Jake... you really have to tidy up your room, pal.
I bet your mother' s told you a thousand times.
First down.
It' s a good game.
Hi, Sy.
I thought you said you were going out today.
Can you help me put this together?
How many prints would you like of these?
Just one set.
Maya, that' s a very beautiful name.
Thank you.
Have you ever picked up prints here before?
It was a long time ago.
Your face looks very familiar.
You work around here?
Sorta near here.
I' ve probably seen you around the mall.
I' m in here pretty often.
Well, we' re a little backed up today.
Is 6: 00 okay?
I probably won' t be able to pick them up till tomorrow or the next day.
See you then.
Thanks.
A little hustle!
Right there.
Good shot.
That' s the way to strike the ball.
You gotta get in front of those, son.
Jake, I want you to drill it, all right?
Visualize where you want the ball to go and drill it.
Good one, Jake.
Jake, that' s not good enough.
All right.
Pay attention, fellas.
Drill it in there, Matt.
Come on!
Good shot.
Good shot.
Next practice, Thursday.
If you can' t make it, be sure and tell Derrick.
Hey, Jake.
Toby, you forgot your sweatshirt.
I thought I' d check it out.
You all right?
Yeah.
Nah, I got my bike.
That was a great shot you made.
But your coach was a little rough.
I thought he should be more supportive.
Do you want me to have a word with him for you?
Nah, it' s okay.
I will.
No, thanks.
When I was your age...
Mmm.
Let' s face it.
I was sick all the time.
Kept comin 'down with mono and hepatitis... and then I broke my collarbone... and I had to wear this weird cast where I kept my arm up like this all winter.
I wasn' t exactly the most popular kid.
How' d you break your collarbone?
Oh, I fell out of a tree.
How' s your dad doing?
Good.
Does he come to see the games?
Yeah, sometimes.
Does he come to see any of the games?
He' s really busy at work.
He' s -- He' s busy all the time.
He sounds like an important guy.
I guess.
He owns a company and everything.
like that cool bike and those soccer shoes.
Hold on.
You know, those things cost money.
He' d be here if he could.
I guess.
I got something for you.
Wanna guess what it is?
What' s wrong?
It' s -- It' s the one you wanted.
Mr. Parrish, I can' t take this.
Sure you can, Jake.
My parents won' t let me.
I' d better be gettin 'back home now.
You sure?
Thanks anyway, Mr. Parrish.
Okay, see you around the store.
Hey, Jake.
The name' s Sy.
Okay, Sy.
There' s been, like, some kind of shift.
I don' t know.
Maybe five weeks.
Six.
No, I know that, but...
This feels different, you know?
I can' t talk right now.
I know.
Bye.
Hi, Sy.
Hi there.
I saw you down here and thought I' d say hello.
I' m just grabbing some shopping fuel.
I never see you away from the store.
After all these years, you' d think we' d run into each other at some point.
Why, do you live around here?
Well, that' s quite a drive.
No, I' m used to it.
You have a nice boy there.
Oh, Jake.
Yeah.
- Aw.
He calls you "Sy the photo guy."
You know, I' ve watched him grow since he was this big.
That' s right.
You' ve been doing our pictures for a long time.
You know, I almost feel like "Uncle Sy."
Well, I' ve got some serious shopping to do, Sy.
Oh, sure.
Oh, my God.
What?
That' s so weird.
l -- l -- I' m --
I' m reading that exact book right now.
You' re kidding.
I can' t believe that you' d be reading that book.
You know, he writes a lot about noticing coincidence, doesn' t he?
Yeah, he does.
Oh.
Wow.
I had no idea you were such a deep thinker, Sy.
I wouldn' t say that.
Me?
No.
I' m not married.
No girlfriend?
No.
I have a snapshot of my mother, though.
She looks very nice.
Oh.
I' m sorry, Sy.
Um, it was really nice chatting with you.
It was nice chatting with you.
I' il probably see you very soon.
We can' t seem to go a day without taking a picture of something, so --
Sy Parrish, please see the manager.
Sy to the manager' s office immediately, please.
What' s with the getup, Sy?
I was doin 'the SRS.
Sy, there' s been some discrepancies in the click count.
Oh, well, that' s probably Yoshi.
You know, his math skills are pretty weak... but I told you about that when you moved him over from audio.
No, all the discrepancies are on the logs that you initialed.
Oh.
I, you know...
I guess sometimes the end of the week you get a little tired --
We' re not talking about a few innocent math errors, Sy.
They always zero out.
The problem is, Sy, that the shutdown clicks don' t correspond at all.
I mean, they don' t even come close to matching the amount of prints that we sold.
Well, then, it' s probably a problem with the reorder counter.
Well, I asked Larry about that.
What did he say?
Well, he looked at the counter and said that it checked out.
He also said that in 14 years of servicing... he' s never seen a faulty counter on an AGFA unit.
Really?
So the question is, Sy... where did all those unaccounted for prints go?
Well, what kind of discrepancy are we talking about, Bill?
Oh!
That' s not possible, Bill.
Oh, no.
I' ve done the math... and the P. O. s confirm it, too.
Well, I don' t know anything about it.
Oh, I think you do, Sy.
Look, Sy, I' ve got a family.
I' m not losing my job over this.
I' m lettin 'you go.
Oh.
These log discrepancies would be enough... but you' ve been spacing out on the job... taking 90 minute lunch breaks... creating scenes in front of the customers... giving away free merchandise.
What?
Free disposable cameras to customers on their birthday?
That must have been your bright idea.
Sure as shit isn' t company policy.
You can' t do this.
It' s done, Sy.
I talked to Sims at district.
Now you finish out the week and clear out your locker.
And if you do somethin 'like fuck up today' s prints --
I haven' t fucked up a customer' s prints in 11 years.
Just get back out there.
Sy.
Jake wanted to get his birthday gift processed.
I' m sorry?
Right.
The birthday gift.
Number of sets?
Oh, just one is fine.
5x7?
Um, the ones we usually get.
Standard.
Didn' t you, Jake?
- Yeah.
What was that address again?
It' s 326 Serrano Terrace.
Sy, are you all right?
I' il have these for you tomorrow.
All right.
Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
I' m leaving early today, Yoshi.
I won' t be coming back, Yoshi.
You were fired?
Yep.
Really?
Wow.
I' ve really enjoyed working with you, Yoshi.
Sy?
Sy, I just wanted to, um... well, I guess I just wanted to say thank you, you know?
For what?
For teachin 'me all this stuff.
You' re welcome, Yoshi.
Don' t let the place go downhill, okay?
I won' t, Sy.
Let me see.
Come on.
What the hell' s wrong with these people?
The universe grows smaller every day.
There must be security for all... or no one is secure.
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
But if you threaten to extend your violence... this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.
Now, we do not pretend to have achieved perfection.
But we do have a system, and it works.
Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
We shall be waiting for your answer.
The decision rests with you.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary... the word "snapshot" was first used in 1808 by an English sportsman by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.
He noted in his diary that almost every bird he shot that day was taken by snapshot... meaning a hurried shot taken without deliberate aim.
Can I help you, Sy?
Just dropping off some film.
Just a customer.
I can still shop here, can' t I, Bill?
No, Sy, you can' t still shop here.
- Shh.
I can' t shop here just because I was fired.
I checked it out.
There' s a thousand other places you could do your photos.
There' s no reason to come all the way down here other than to fuck with me.
There' s a very good reason.
I calibrated that machine personally.
It' s the best mini- lab in the state.
All right, Sy.
Just this one time.
But I' m telling you... find another place to do your film.
I do not want you back in here.
Thanks, Bill.
You can' t just
leave your station unmanned down there.
I think you need to see these, sir.
What have you got there?
Is it the anal sex fiend again?
Motherfucker.
Mr. Parrish' s demeanor was when he came in?
Demeanor?
How did he seem?
Did he seem upset or agitated in any way?
He seemed fine.
Sy and I had some words when he came into the store.
Under the circumstances, I was surprised to see him... and I asked him what he was doing here... and I... I suggested in strong language that in the future he bring his pictures somewhere else.
Yoshi, I' m gonna need to make some Xerox copies of this.
Yeah.
Mr. Owens, why don' t you come and grab a seat and try to calm down?
Uh... they' re at my mother' s.
I' m -- I' m sorry.
I' m just a little upset.
It' s...
It' s understandable.
I' ve had to fire a lot of people, Detective.
People get upset when they get fired.
He got pretty upset.
He knew that Mr. Araki would see the photos... and he knew he' d show them to you and that you' d call us.
I think it' s just a warning.
But you have to take it seriously.
Oh, we take it very seriously.
Your child' s life has been indirectly threatened.
We take no chances in this county.
Officers are en route to his apartment now with a search warrant.
I' ve got plainclothes officers on standby inside the store and out.
He may not.
It' s hard to say.
I doubt he will.
You really think that' s a good idea?
I mean, this place is wall- to- wall families.
Are you insane?
I' m just trying to make --
That' s crazy.
He must be programmed for courage.
Mr. Parrish!
It' s clear.
Double 6, 3- 2- 1.
Go ahead, 3- 2- 1.
I need to be patched through to Van Der Zee in TMU.
Right away, please.
Hey, Dan... take a look at this.
What do you got?
Y- O- R- K- l- N.
I don' t find that name registered.
Could you try a Maya Burson?
B- U- R- S- O- N.
Let me check that for you, sir.
I' il ring that room for you now, sir.
Hello?
This is room service.
I' m sorry to bother you... but we have your order all ready to go here.
We just needed to know if you' d like coffee with that.
Uh... Will, did you want coffee?
No, just the drinks.
Um... no.
We' re 511.
511.
I must be looking at the wrong thing here.
I' m sorry.
Okay, thanks.
Hotel operator.
Room service, please.
Room service.
This is Jon.
May I take your order please?
Hello, Jon.
This is Will Yorkin in 511.
We' ve decided to go out for lunch.
I was wondering if it' s okay to cancel our order.
No problem.
That was 511, right?
That' s right, Jon.
Thank you very much.
You' re welcome, Mr. Yorkin.
Yes?
Nina Yorkin?
Hi.
I' m Detective Van Der Zee of the Evans County Threat Management Unit.
This is Detective Outerbridge.
Is Jake all right?
No, no.
We, uh... actually, we need to speak with your husband William.
Will' s at work.
What' s this about?
No.
Sure.
Hi.
I need a room.
But not too high a foor.
I' il check, sir.
Yes, we can offer you 313.
Mmm.
I' il check, sir.
Will Yorkin' s office.
Duane, this is Nina.
I need to talk to Will right now.
He' s not in, Mrs. Yorkin, but I can have him return as soon as he gets back.
Duane, I need you to get him on the phone immediately.
Okay.
I' il try him right now.
I' il put you on hold.
He -- He' s trying right now.
Where' s your son, Mrs. Yorkin?
He' s at his friend Eric' s house.
It might be a good idea to have Eric' s mother drive him home now.
Oh, my God.
Yes, Duane.
I called his cell.
But I left him a 911 pager.
He should call you the second he --
Duane, I know he' s fucking Maya Burson... and I don' t give a shit about that right now.
I just need you to tell me where he is!
Room service.
No, ma' am.
I' m afraid you have to sign for this.
Uh, just a second.
Get on the bed.
Get on the goddamn bed!
Look, I' ve got plenty of cash in my pants in the wallet in the bathroom --
Shut up!
Close them!
I closed the drapes.
Did I tell you to wrap a towel around yourself?
No.
Let me explain what' s going on here.
I tell you to do things, then you fucking do them exactly like I tell you.
I' m gonna tell you this one time and one time only.
Yeah.
Do you understand me?
Yes.
Now get on the bed.
- No!
Am I talking to a brick wall?
No.
I don' t want you to touch her.
If you touch her again, I stab you in the heart.
Can you ring the room once more, please?
I' il try it one more time.
Now, missy, have to take the robe off.
- Aah!
I' m telling.
She can do it!
What' s this?
Can' t you stop your sniveling?
This is supposed to look like fun.
No touching!
Smile.
You have to look like you' re having fun...
Come on!
Smile!
Wipe your nose.
You look disgusting.
Now... put his thing in your mouth.
Pretend.
This is all pretend.
I' m doing it!
Stop yelling at me.
Like this!
Oh, God!
No!
Yes.
I' m Detective Van Der Zee.
This is Detective Outerbridge.
Right.
So, uh... what is all this about?
No.
Have you seen this man?
This guy just checked in about... half an hour ago.
What room?
I put him in 519.
Mr. Belmer, I need a passkey now, please.
Mr. Parrish, this is the police.
Will you open the door, please?
We owe a --
Let' s find Yorkin.
Check 511.
Where is it?
It' s in the back, rear kitchen- access.
Miss Burson?
Freeze!
Drop the bag!
Do it!
I just took pictures.
If you give up the right to remain silent... anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
We got him.... the right to speak with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning.
Dad!
Are you married, Detective?
You have any children?
I' il be the one asking the questions here, Sy.
I know.
Detective, are you a family man?
That' s none of your business, Sy.
Sir, you' re right, it isn' t.
It is none of my business.
But I' m guessing by your answer and that ring on your finger that you are... and that makes you a very fortunate man.
I can also tell by the way that you' ve treated me so far and the way you carry out your job, you' re a good man... good husband and father... a man who appreciates his good fortune.
You' re not the type of father who' d cheat on his wife... hurt his family, betray their trust.
You would never neglect and abuse your children.
Make horrible demands of your children.
You would never ask...
you would never ask your children to do things... things that children shouldn' t do.
You would never take disgusting, sick... degraded pictures of your children d -- doing these things.
You would never treat your children like animals.
Will Yorkin had it all, and he threw it all away.
He' s not a good father.
Well, I, uh... ahem.
I think I understand now, Sy.
You' re welcome.
Can I see my pictures now?
Thank you.
Peter.
You could not watch even one hour with me?
Master, what has happened to you?
Should I call the others, Lord?
No, John.
I don' t want them to see me like this.
Are you in danger?
Should we flee, Master?
Watch...... pray.
What is wrong with him?
He seems afraid.
He had spoken about danger while we ate...
He mentioned betrayal and...
Thirty.
Thirty, Judas.
That was the agreement between me... and you?
Yes.
Where?
Where is he?
Hear me, Father.
Rise up, defend me.
Save me from the traps they set for me.
Do you really believe...... that one man can bear...... the full burden of sin?
Shelter me, O Lord.
I trust in You.
In You I take refuge.
No one man can carry this burden...... I tell you.
It is far too heavy.
Saving their souls is too costly.
No one.
Ever.
No.
Never.
Father, you can do all things.
If it is possible, let this chalice pass from me...
But let Your will be done...... not mine.
Who is your father?
Who are you?
Who are you looking for?
We' re looking for Jesus of Nazareth.
I am he.
Hail, Rabbi!
Judas...... you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?
Peter!
Put it down!
Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword.
Put it down.
Malchus!
Get up!
We' ve got him.
Let' s go!
What, Mary?
What is it?
Listen...
"Why is this night different from every other night?"
"Because once we were slaves...
"... and we are slaves no longer..."
They' ve seized him!
To the courtyard of the High Priest.
Quick!
Go!
Halt!
Not so fast.
This is not your party, you toothless vermin.
Peter...
Hey!
What' s going on here?
In there!
Stop them!
They' ve arrested him!
In secret!
In the night!
To hide their crime from you!
Stop them!
What are you yelling about, woman?
Who have they arrested?
Jesus.
Jesus of Nazareth!
Shut up!
She' s crazy.
A criminal.
Brought in for questioning, that' s all.
Broke the temple laws.
I see.
Better go tell him there' s more trouble brewing.
Tell who?
Abenader, you idiot.
Get going!
Go!
Jesus...
Are you hungry?
Yes, I am.
This is certainly a tall table!
Who is it for?
A rich man.
Does he like to eat standing up?
He prefers to eat like... so.
Tall table, tall chairs!
Well, I haven' t made them yet.
This will never catch on!
Oh, no you don' t!
Take off that dirty apron before you come in.
And wash your hands.
It has begun, Lord.
So be it.
Sir, there' s trouble at...
What, in the middle of the night, Abenader?
I' m sorry.
What' s the problem?
Trouble within the walls.
Caiphas had some prophet arrested.
Who?
Some Galilean.
The Pharisees apparently hate the man.
A Galilean?
Who are you talking about?
Who is this beggar you bring to us...... chained up like a condemned man?
He' s Jesus, the Nazarene troublemaker.
You' re Jesus of Nazareth?
They say you' re a king.
Where is this kingdom of yours?
What line of kings do you descend from?
Speak up!
You' re just the son of some obscure carpenter, no?
Some say you' re Elijah.
But he was carried off to heaven in a chariot!
Why don' t you say something?
You' ve been brought here as a blasphemer!
What do you say to that?
Defend yourself.
I have spoken openly to everyone.
I' ve taught...... in the temple where we all gather.
Ask those who have heard what I have to say.
With arrogance?
If I have spoken evil...... tell me what evil I have said.
But if not, why do you hit me?
Yes, we' il listen to those who heard your blasphemies.
Good!
Let' s hear them.
He cures the sick by magic!
With the help of devils!
I' ve seen it.
He casts out devils, with the help of devils.
He calls himself the King of the Jews!
No, he calls himself the Son of God!
He said he would destroy the temple...... and rebuild it in three days!
Worse!
He claims he' s the Bread of Life!
And if we don' t eat his flesh or drink his blood...... we won' t inherit eternal life.
Silence!
You' re all under this man' s spell.
Either offer proof of his wrongdoing...... or be quiet!
This entire proceeding is an outrage.
All I' ve heard from these witnesses is mindless contradiction!
Who called this meeting anyway?
And at this hour of the night?
Where are the other members of the council?
Get him out of here!
Get out!
A travesty!
That' s what this is, a beastly travesty!
Haven' t you anything to say?
No answer to these accusations?
I ask you now...... Jesus of Nazareth...
Tell us, are you the Messiah?
The son of the living God?
I AM...... and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power...... and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Blasphemy!
You heard him.
There' s no need for witnesses!
Your verdict.
What is your verdict?
Death!
Haven' t I seen you in the company of the Galilean?
Yes!
You' re one of his disciples!
I recognize you!
Quiet!
I' ve never met the man.
I don' t know him.
You are Peter!
One of the disciples of Jesus.
I don' t know the man!
You are wrong!
Stop!
Stop!
I' ve seen you before!
Stop him!
He' s one of them!
You' re wrong, damn you!
I swear I don' t know the man.
I' ve never seen him before.
Wherever you go, Lord...... I will follow.
To prison, even to death.
Amen, I say to you...... before the cock crows...... three times you will deny me.
Peter?
I am unworthy!
I have denied him, Mother!
Denied him three times.
Let' s go!
You take care of it.
Let him pass.
He' s harmless.
Release him!
Take back the silver.
Here!
I' ve sinned, betrayed innocent blood.
Take back your silver.
I don' t want it!
If you think you' ve betrayed innocent blood, that' s your affair.
Take your money and go.
Now go!
What' s wrong?
Are you all right?
Look at his mouth.
Hey, can we look at it?
You need help?
Can we help?
He' s bleeding!
Look!
Blood!
Leave me alone...... you little satans!
Aha!
Cursing!
Are you cursed?
He' s cursed!
Yes, a curse!
It' s inside him, look!
Watch out, it' s like burning oil from his bones!
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!
Don' t condemn this Galilean.
He' s holy.
You will only bring trouble on yourself.
Do you want to know my idea of trouble, Claudia?
This stinking outpost, that filthy rabble out there.
Do you always punish your prisoners before they' re judged?
Governor...
What accusations do you bring against this man?
Well...
If he weren' t a malefactor, we wouldn' t have brought him before you.
That' s not what I asked.
Why don' t you judge him according to your own laws?
Consul, you know it' s unlawful for us...... to condemn any man to death.
To death?
What has this man done to merit such a penalty?
He has violated our Sabbath, Consul.
Go on...
He has seduced the people...... taught foul, disgusting doctrines.
Isn' t he the prophet you welcomed into Jerusalem only five days ago?
And now you want him dead?
Can any of you explain this madness to me?
Your Excellency, please...
So far the high priest hasn' t told you this man' s greatest crime.
He has become the leader of a large and dangerous sect...... who hail him as the Son of David!
He claims that he is the Messiah...... the king promised to the Jews.
He has forbidden his followers to pay tribute to the emperor, Consul!
Bring him here!
Go!
Drink.
Are you the king of the Jews?
Does this question come from you?
Or do you ask me this because others have told you that is what I am?
Why would I ask you that?
Am I a Jew?
Your high priests, your own people delivered you up to me.
They want me to have you executed.
Why?
What have you done?
Are you a king?
My kingdom is not of this world.
If it were...... do you think my followers would have let them hand me over?
Then you are a king?
That is why I was born.
To give testimony to the truth.
All men who hear the truth hear my voice.
Truth!
What is truth?
I have questioned this prisoner, and I find no cause in him.
This man is a Galilean, is he not?
He is.
Then he is King Herod' s subject.
Let Herod judge him.
Governor...
Hand him over.
Jesus of Nazareth!
Where?
Where is he?
This...... is Jesus of Nazareth?
Is it true that you restore sight to the blind?
Raise men from the dead?
Where do you get your power?
Are you the one whose birth was foretold?
Answer me!
Are you a king?
How about me?
Will you work a little miracle for me?
Take this stupid fool out of my sight.
He' s not guilty of a crime, he' s just crazy.
Give him a fool' s homage...
What is truth, Claudia?
Do you hear it, recognize it when it is spoken?
Yes, I do.
Don' t you?
How?
Can you tell me?
If you will not hear the truth, no one can tell you.
Truth...
Do you want to know what my truth is, Claudia?
I' ve been putting down rebellions in this rotten outpost for eleven years.
If I don' t condemn this man...... I know Caiphas will start a rebellion.
If I do condemn him, then his followers may.
Either way, there will be bloodshed.
Caesar has warned me, Claudia.
Warned me twice.
He swore that the next time the blood would be mine.
That is my truth!
Herod refuses to condemn the man.
They' re bringing him back here.
We' re going to need reinforcements.
I don' t want to cause an uprising.
There is already an uprising.
King Herod found no cause in this man.
Neither do I.
Men!
Attend to the crowd!
Quiet!
Have you no respect for our Roman procurator?
As you know, every year I release a criminal back to you.
We are now holding a notorious murderer...... Barabbas.
Or Jesus, called the Messiah?
He is not the Messiah!
He is an imposter!
A blasphemer!
Free Barabbas!
Again I ask you: which of these two men should I release to you?
Free Barabbas!
Free him.
What would you have me do with Jesus the Nazarene?
Have him crucified!
No!
I will chastise him...... but then I will set him free.
See to it that the punishment is severe, Abenader.
But don' t let them kill the man.
My heart is ready, Father...... my heart is ready.
My son...... when, where, how...... will you choose to be delivered of this?
If the world hates you...... remember that it has hated me first.
Remember also that no servant is greater than his master.
If they persecuted me, they will persecute you.
You must not be afraid.
The Helper will come...... who reveals the truth about God...... and who comes from the Father.
Stop!
Enough!
Your orders were to punish this man...
... not to scourge him to death!
Take him away.
Get going!
Get him out of here!
Your majesty...
Take care of it.
A beautiful rose bush.
Look at him... king of the worms!
Hail, wormy king!
A color fit for a king!
We' re here to pay our respects.
A leader for our brotherhood!
Behold the man.
Crucify him!
Isn' t this enough?
Look at him!
Crucify him!
Shall I crucify your king?
We have no king but Caesar!
Speak to me.
I have the power to crucify you, or else to set you free.
You have no power over me...... except what is given you from above.
Therefore, it is he who delivered me to you...... who has the greater sin.
If you free him, Governor...... you are no friend of Caesar' s.
You must crucify him!
It is you who want to crucify him, not I. Look you to it.
I am innocent of this man' s blood.
Sleep well, oh people of Bagdad!
All is quiet!
Sleep!
Sleep, oh dwellers of Bagdad!
All is quiet!
Look straight ahead of you!
Go!
Sleep, oh people of Bagdad.
All is quiet.
The name?!
Tell me, wise star!
Tell me the name!
Aladdin, son of Ali Al Marouf!
Aladdin, son of Ali Al Marouf!
Oh, most esteemed sprinkler of the streets!
Do you know a certain Aladdin, son of Ali Al Marouf?
You' re sure you don' t mean Karim who fell into the pond and ran stark naked around the town?
Or maybe Houssein who hoisted his donkey to the minaret?
Where are you going?
Wait!
Oh, masters of the best of games except for playing with dice!
Could you tell me...
Oh, honored one, where might I find Aladdin, son of Ali Al Marouf?
Bagdad is a large city...
You' ve been reading for 2 hours without paying me a thing!
Oh, most worthy keeper of knowledge!..
People of Bagdad!
The beauty of all beauties, the unrivaled Princess Boudour, honors the baths with her presence!
Any who dares to look upon the Princess shall lose his head!
I don' t want to!
I don' t want to bathe!
I don' t want to!
- I don' t want to!
- What do you want, then?
I want him to look upon me.
- Then he' il have his head cut off.
- So what?
Mustafa!
- Young man, open your eyes!
- Come on, and you' il have no head.
I wish that a wild lion would pounce on you, so that I could kill him.
I wish that a fire would engulf all Bagdad and I' d rescue you.
leaving only two of us, you and me.
- What name were you given?
- Aladdin, son of Ali Al Marouf.
- You can' t take the Princess' hand.
- I' ve already done so.
Cut off his head anyway...
Strike the blow!
What' s the matter with you?
Catch him, dead or alive!
Mother!
I held the hand of the Sultan' s daughter, Boudour!
You must ask the Sultan for his daughter' s hand.
And yesterday he said he was flying on dragons.
ls this not the dwelling of the Chosen One and the King of Luck, Aladdin?
Aladdin is my son.
Here are presents for you from your uncle!
I didn' t know my husband was blessed with a brother.
ls this not the house of Aladdin, son of Ali Al Marouf?
- From my uncle?
- Your uncle.
They must have made a mistake.
They' il come and take it all back.
Where is my brother?
Where' s my brother, Ali Al Marouf?
Ali Al Marouf has been dead for three years.
I was his best friend.
Oh, my miserable brother!
Oh, how cruel and bitter my fate!
Forty years have I wandered over the earth!
I dreamed of coming back and embracing my brother!
But my Ali didn' t have any brother.
Believing me dead he couldn' t bear to mention my name.
Where is the place the deceased loved most?
- Where' s my nephew Aladdin?
- There!
My cherished nephew, tell me your innermost desire.
I shall grant it.
He will ask you for a star from the heavens.
He has just wanted me to ask for Princess Boudour' s hand!
- Could he be possessed by genies?
- I will cure him.
Leave us now!
For 40 years I have studied alchemy and black magic with the wisest men of all Maghrib.
Forty years have I dedicated to the preparation of magic powders that' d open the gates of dungeons and reveal the darkest secrets.
Put your trust in me.
I will help you.
- Where are we going, Uncle?
- To an enchanted city.
Why?
You alone will penetrate a place from which no one' s ever returned.
There you' il find an old bronze lamp.
Repeat it!
An old bronze lamp...
You will bring it to me and all your wishes will be granted.
Go now!
The entrance is there!
You' il get in the shadow of the city and in the city of shadows.
- Who is there?
Who sneezed?
Show yourself!
Why have you come here?
I came to find the lamp!
Amazing!
lncredible!
He said the truth!
I must have the lamp and I' ve just told you so.
- What shall we do?
- I don' t know.
Hey!
Where are you?
Where are you hiding?
Silence!
You' re disturbing our meditation!
Take the lamp.
It is yours.
Where will I find it?
Show him the way.
This way.
This way!
This way!
ls this it?
- What are you doing, Uncle?
- Uncle?!
Where are you?
Come back at once!
Aladdin, I was only joking!
Aladdin!
I hear and obey!
Who are you?
I' m this lamp' s slave.
I' m at your command!
- Are you a Genie?
- Yes.
Why did my uncle want to kill me?
He is not your uncle.
He' s an evil Maghribian sorcerer.
We Genies have long known him.
I' m yours to command!
To do what?
What you will.
Strangle him?
Drown him?
Reduce him to dust?
No!
Let him go to all four corners of the earth.
To all four corners of the earth?
I hear and obey!
I don' t want to!
We don' t want to!
The blessings of Allah be upon you!
Wake up!
It' s time to bake cakes.
Allah has granted us another fine day.
I wish I had a skewer of shish kebab!
- I didn' t know you were a joker!
- You play little jokes, too.
Who started the fire?
I didn' t know you could make cakes.
I' m eighty five, but never have I made a single cake.
- Have a cake!
- Genies never eat cakes.
- What do Genies eat, then?
- Nothing at all.
I' d like you to meet my friend the Genie.
I' d rather stay in the lamp.
I knew that all that reading would end up badly.
Remember, I haven' t seen anything.
You haven' t seen anything either.
Neither of us have seen anything.
Do you know why I have lived to be 85?
Because all life I' ve been saying:
"All is quiet in Bagdad!"
To live to be 100 years old, you must learn to be virtuous.
The basis for all good is in holding the spirit in check, in humility and in piety, and above all in chastity, in patience and modesty.
Each of us must know when to give proof of our modesty and when to show impertinence.
And to act so as to be permanently exploring good.
Because the state of perfection is modesty, and the state of evil is another kind of modesty.
Will you come out for a second?
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.
Guards!
Don' t be afraid!
- Who are you?
- Who am l?
- And who are you?
- Who am l?
- But who are you?
- Princess Boudour.
- The Princess Boudour.
- Who' s that mumbling there?
Where' s that voice coming from?
It' s a loafer who' s listened to too many silly stories.
Come here!
- What' s that?
- Ajar.
- And what' s that?
- That?
- An oven!
- An oven...
For baking meat cakes.
- You understand?
- No.
What is this mysterious monster?
- It' s a goat, not a monster.
- Does it make the cheese?
- How old are you?
- I' m sixteen.
I already knew what a goat is when I was three years old.
They' re looking for someone.
Perhaps for the Bagdad thief.
They' re not looking forjust one, but for forty of them.
- Ah, it' s you?
- Yes, it' s me.
Why are you laughing?
I know what you' re going to ask me.
What?
I' ve already been asked by 1 7 princes.
Poor princes.
I refused them all.
Then it' s "no"?
Why not?
Go to my father and ask for my hand.
And will you say "yes"?
How should I know what I' il say?
I' il say whatever comes to my head!
The Princess is here!
That' s you again!
- Tie him up!
- Yes!
Tie him!
I hope Princess Boudour will forgive me!
My Sultan, he' s the one who dared gaze on the Princess twice.
Sultan!
It' s real luck, my meeting you like this.
I' m asking for the hand of Princess Boudour.
- What did he say?
- My tongue refuses to repeat it.
Your daughter likes me and I like her.
Only she says she won' t marry me without your permission.
Yes, sire.
Our great Sultan asks whether you know, young man, that seventeen princes...
Eighteen princes!
That 19 princes have already come to ask for the fair Boudour' s hand.
She did tell me that.
Before asking for marriage, you should offer the Sultan presents.
- You mean rubies and emeralds?
- Precisely!
Oh, I forgot about that!
I' il have them brought here right away.
Do you have a treasure buried at your house?
I' ve got no treasure.
- What?
- A Genie.
Stay there!
Throw him in the dungeon!
Daughter of ours!
- We' re most displeased.
- I' m the one who' s displeased!
There' re no princes left.
And you did it in order to end up in a beggar' s hut.
Don' t you dare call him that bad name!
- What name should I call him?
- Aladdin!
From now on we shall call by name every beggar and good- for- nothing.
Shut up!
Who is to shut up?
Us?
You will set him free at once and ask for his forgiveness.
Those were your last words.
We' il have you wedded today.
- Try and see what happens.
- I' il try.
Well, so!
- Remember it and write it down!
- Write it down.
We shall give our daughter and half our kingdom to...
To the very first man to walk through that door.
From now on, half our kingdom and our daughter belong to your son.
Out of my way!
Grab the Princess!
No one has anything to suggest to us?
- There is a way.
- Speak up.
How?
The Princess must be told it was just a dream.
Since it was but a dream and nothing has happened to her, she will be obedient again.
And the heart of our great Sultan will rejoice.
And what does the Great Wiseman say?
A dream' s not that' s not a dream, and not a dream is not a dream.
So to say of not a dream that it' s a dream is the same as to say of a dream that it' s not.
We order to say of a dream that it is not one, and of not a dream, that it' s a dream...
The Princess went nowhere.
She dreamed it all.
Everybody understood us?
Be off with you!
I even saw in a dream that I taught crocodiles to read in Persian.
I have also dreamed that I was a minaret and that from my top the muezzins were crying.
I have even dreamed that my hair walked to the bazaar to buy a comb.
So what?
So you' ve only dreamed about that beggar.
lf I dreamed it, how come Mubarak fought with him?
Mubarak!
I' m told that yesterday you fought with some beggar.
Yesterday I didn' t go any place.
I mean I hunted and killed...
A lion.
A lion!
Yes!
I remember it very well.
- A goat.
It' s true.
And Mustafa brought me back to the palace.
Mustafa!
Who?
Me?
The last two days I spent in bed with a toothache.
Our daughter Boudour, we' re not angry with you.
Tell me, it did happen, didn' t it?
You did scold me about Aladdin!
I scolded you about Prince Abou Abdul ibn- Abdul...
- No!
Aladdin!
- I' ve never heard of Aladdin.
How can it be?
Aladdin!
Then I dreamed it.
All this was just a dream.
Tomorrow you' il lose your head.
Any other news?
Do you hear that music?
I' m marrying Princess Boudour!
Are you in there?
I hear and obey.
Have you no shame?
What?
Why did you let them throw Aladdin in a dungeon?
All you had to do is to rub the lamp.
- Couldn' t you guess it yourself?
- It' s not my concern.
I knew it would end badly!
Oh, my heart' s joy!
My little camel!
Bring Aladdin back!
Take your lamp and your Genie!
I never want to see them again!
I' il teach you how to fly on dragons!
I' il teach you how to ask for Princess Boudour' s hand!
I pray that' s not the goat!
The lamp will be mine!
Oh, the brightest of all stars!
He flew away!
He' s flown away!
- Who has flown away?
Mubarak!
What is the meaning of this?
Get me down from here!
What are you doing there?
Come down!
I can' t!
How did you climb up there?
Let him stay up there!
Jump!
I' m stuck!
- Why did you climb up there?
- I didn' t climb up there.
Everybody saw you up there!
Since you climbed up there, you might as well say so.
Oh great Sultan, pardon this foolish child!
It is only because he' s young and has too much passion.
All right.
We' il leave them once more.
Stay here!
- What if he flies away again?
- Just let him try to.
Oh, heavenly one...
Oh, the brightest of all...... stars!
Good night, Boudour!
I' m the son of the Grand Vizier!
What a clever Genie!
What would the son of a vizier be doing in a jar?
Make way for the Great Sultan!
So, whoever is stuffed in the jar claims to be my son!
Who is in there?
Mubarak! ls that you?
- Get them all out of here!
- Get them out!
- Why did you get in the jar?
- I didn' t.
Lousy liar!
Everyone saw you in thatjar.
Why did you stuff yourself in there?
Whether or not he got in there no longer interests us.
lf he prefers stuffing jars to half my kingdom and my daughter, just let him stuff them.
Announce it to all of Bagdad!
From this moment on, the son of the Vizier and Princess Boudour are no longer husband and wife!
ln ten thousand years I haven' t laughed so much!
Let' s stuff someone else into a jar!
Wait.
We' ve other things to do.
Go away!
Why?
Because when I wake up and you' re not here, it will be so painful.
Wait!
Let this dream go on and on...
I don' t want to wake up.
It' s no dream.
I simply have a Genie friend.
Don' t you believe me?
Rub this.
Then it wasn' t a dream, but pure and simple magic?
- You can do anything?
- That' s right!
You must swear it.
It' s you women who need to swear, but we Genies always speak the truth.
Well, then, bring me a peach.
So it was real!
I was not dreaming at all.
They have deceived me!
- What' s all this for?
- The wedding!
- Whose wedding?
- Ours.
Don' t interefere.
- Salam.
- Salam.
What is all this?
- What does it mean?
- It means you' re sleeping.
- What d' you mean, I' m sleeping?
- They are sleeping, too.
And I' m too.
We' re all sleeping and seeing a dream.
Now we' il have a wedding!
Here' s my fiance!
You' re in prison, aren' t you?
Now you see it' s just a dream!
Don' t try to confuse us.
What says the Vizier?
- Let the Wiseman speak first.
- What says the Wiseman?
The realization of knowledge is a sign of ignorance, and...
- But why me?
- And why me rather than you?
A goat!
Yes, a goat!
It is my goat!
Look!
- Don' t be afraid.
It' s a dream.
- Let me explain it.
Don' t be scared!
Everything' s possible here!
We' re just dreaming.
You understand?
He doesn' t!
Don' t be afraid!
Look.
I' m pushing you.
Now you push me!
That' s right!
Be seated, honored guests.
After all, it' s a wedding!
Look at him.
Where' s he now? ln prison.
Oh, when we wake up, have him executed too.
And what is he now?
A bridegroom at his wedding.
He is happy!
And we are happy!
lsn' t it swell to have a wedding!
When I married your father, it was not in a dream.
- Give the lamp back.
- No, I won' t.
- I don' t want it this way.
Give it.
- And I like it this way.
Don' t quarrel.
I' il give you a spinning wheel.
- And what is that?
- You will like it.
No mercy for me, and no forgiveness, my dear nephew!
Kill me as you would kill a mad dog.
Or I shall kill myself and take the sin on my soul!
- What' s stopping you?
- To the count of three.
One.
Two.
We' d better awaken.
Two and a half.
Aladdin, don' t spoil the wedding!
Two and a quarter!
I forgive you.
Why does no one glorify us?
Oh incomparable Sultan, whose brightness is eclipsing moon and sun and fiery meteors, and all the world' s emperors!
This pleases us.
I shall go milk the goat.
- Give the lamp back.
- No, I will not!
- Give it back!
- No, I won' t!
Will you give it back?
I want our wedding to be real and not a dream.
It is real.
lf you don' t give it, I' m going!
Then you don' t love me.
And take your lamp, too!
- We call you.
- I won' t come!
- Come out!
- No, I won' t!
- What are you supposed to say?
- I hear and obey.
- I' m the lamp' s slave.
- Repeat it.
- I' m the lamp' s slave.
Louder!
I can' t hear you!
I' m the lamp' s slave!
The wedding is going on.
I' m the bridegroom!
Sultan.
A miracle' s happened!
Long live the new Sultan Al Salam Kerim!
A sultan the world has not yet beheld.
The wisest of all sultans!
The wisest.
I ask your forgiveness.
But I have to kill you.
Go ahead, kill me!
I' m your friend, but I' m the lamp' s slave!
Yes, of course.
I' m the lamp' s slave, but I' m your friend!
A slave or a friend?
Get in this jug.
- Why?
- You' il live in the jug.
- No Genie ever lived in a jug.
- You' il be the first then.
All right?
Rub me.
I hear and obey.
I dreamed I was a Sultan.
Don' t get distracted.
Come out!
I dreamed I milked a goat.
like the constellation of the Lion among ordinary lions, shines the name of our great...
Traitor!
Our daughter Boudour!
Won' t you come in?
All is quiet in Bagdad.
All is quiet in Bagdad, all is quiet, quiet,
All is quiet in Bagdad, all is quiet, quiet...
For children up to 16 years old...
Hi.
I' ve got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.
My name is Jack Torrance.
His office is the first door on the left.
Thank you.
Mr. Ullman?
I' m Jack Torrance.
Come on in, Jack.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
This is my secretary, Susie.
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours.
That' s very good time.
Sit down a minute, Jack.
Just make yourself at home.
Like some coffee?
lf you' re having some, I wouldn' t mind.
Thanks.
- Susie.
- Sure.
And ask Bill Watson to join us.
Yes, I will.
Mom?
Yeah?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure I do.
It' il be lots of fun.
Yeah.
I guess so.
Yeah, I guess so.
What about Tony?
He' s looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
No, I aín 't, Mrs. Torrance.
Now, come on, Tony.
I just don 't.
Bill, I' d like you to meet Jack Torrance.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Grab a chair, Bill.
Fine.
What line of work are you in now?
I' m looking for a change.
I was about to explain...... that our season here runs from May 1 5th to October 30th.
Then we close down completely until the following May.
It would be.
It gets 20 feet of snow during the winter.
When the place was built in 1 907...... there was very little interest in winter sports.
This site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.
Did they give you any idea in Denver...... about what the job entails?
This consists mainly of running the boiler...... heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis...... repairing damage as it occurs...... and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold.
That sounds fine to me.
Physically, it' s not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...... is a tremendous sense of isolation.
That' s very good, Jack.
Because, for some people...... solitude...... and isolation...... can, of itself, become a problem.
Not for me.
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they' il take to it?
They' il love it.
Before I turn you over to Bill...... there' s one other thing I think we should talk about.
Not to sound melodramatic...... but it' s been known to give a few people...... second thoughts about the job.
I' m intrigued.
I don' t suppose they said anything in Denver...... about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1 970.
I don' t believe they did.
My predecessor in this job...... hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.
He came up with his wife and 2 little girls of about 8 and 1 0.
He had a good employment record, good references.
And from what I' ve been told, he seemed...... like a completely normal individual.
But at some point during the winter...... he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.
He ran amuck...
... and killed his family with an ax.
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.
The police thought...... that it was what the old- timers used to call cabin fever.
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...... when people are shut in together over long periods of time.
That is...... quite a story.
Yeah, it is.
It' s still hard for me to believe it actually happened here.
But it did.
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.
I certainly can.
I also understand why your people in Denver...... left it for you to tell me.
Obviously, some people can be put off...... from staying in a place where something like that happened.
You can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me.
And as far as my wife is concerned...... l' m sure she' il be absolutely fascinated when I tell her.
She' s a confirmed ghost story...... and horror film addict.
Tony, do you think Dad' il get the job?
He already díd.
He' s goíng to phone Wendy up ín a few mínutes to tell her.
- Hi, babe.
- Hí, hon.
How' s ít goíng?
Great.
I' m at the hotel and I still have a lot to do.
I don' t think I can get home before 9 or 1 0.
Sounds like you got the job.
Right.
It' s a beautiful place.
You and Danny are going to love it.
You do too know.
I don 't want to.
Now, hold your eyes still so I can see.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.
If you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Because he hides.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
That' s fine.
Do I have to?
I' d like you to.
We' re going in the other room for a few minutes and talk.
I' il come back and check on you.
- Shall we go into the living room?
Mrs. Torrance, I don' t think you have anything to worry about.
IKids can scare you to death.
But believe me, these episodes are not at all uncommon.
Most of the time, these episodes with kids are never explained.
They' re brought on by emotional factors and rarely occur again.
Have you been in Boulder long?
We' re from Vermont.
Tony.
Let' s see....
He didn' t like it too much at first.
Then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while and....
I guess that' s about when I first noticed he was talking to Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
How did he manage to do that?
Purely an accident.
So he wasn' t exactly in the greatest mood that night.
And Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room...... and my husband grabbed his arm to pull him away from them.
Wasn' t it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Jack.
Don' t worry, Mom.
See, it' s okay.
- 8: 30.
- Bye.
Good morning.
We had time to grab a bite to eat.
Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.
No, my son' s discovered the games room.
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.
ln view of all we have to cover today...... l suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started.
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
It sure is.
Are all these lndian designs authentic?
They' re really gorgeous.
As a matter of fact...... this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I' ve ever seen.
All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
And here are your quarters.
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.
Perfect for a child.
If you feel like spreading out...... you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
This is our famous hedge maze.
The walls are 1 3 feet high...... and the hedge is as old as the hotel itself.
A lot of fun, but I wouldn' t want to go in there...... unless I had an hour to spare to find my way out.
When was the Overlook built?
Construction started in 1 907.
The site' s supposed to be on an lndian burial ground.
They actually had to repel...... a few lndian attacks as they were building it.
Can you both drive a car?
Basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car.
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
We don' t drink.
Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Glad to meet you.
That' s just great.
How do you folks like our hotel so far?
I found him outside looking for you.
Come on over here.
See you later, hon.
That' s nice.
This is the kitchen, huh?
ls it big enough for you?
This whole place is such an enormous maze.
I' il have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
A lot of this stuff you' il never have to touch.
One thing for sure, you don' t have to worry about food.
Right here is our walk- in freezer.
This is where we keep all of our meat.
You got 1 5 rib roasts...... 30 ten- pound bags of hamburger.
We got 1 2 turkeys, about 40 chickens...... 50 sirloin steaks, two dozen of pork roast...... and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?
You don' t?
What' s your favorite food, then?
French fries and ketchup.
I think we can manage that too, Doc.
Come along, now.
Watch your step.
How' d you know we call him Doc?
- Doc.
You called Danny "Doc" twice.
I did?
We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.
But how did you know?
I guess I probably heard you call him that.
It' s possible.
But I honestly don' t remember...... calling him that since we' ve been with you.
What' s up, Doc?
Now, this is the storeroom.
In here is where we keep...... all the dried goods and the canned goods.
We got canned fruits and vegetables...... canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals.
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes, Sugar Puffs...... Rice IKrispies, oatmeal, Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.
You got a dozen jugs of black molasses.
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...
How' d you like some ice cream, Doc?
Sociables, finger rolls...... and 7 kinds of what have you.
Now, we' ve got dried peaches, dried apricots...... dried raisins and dried prunes.
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.
- How' re you getting on?
- Fine.
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We' re on our way to the basement.
I promise we won' t keep her very long.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.
I was just getting to the ice cream.
You like ice cream, Doc?
You folks mind if I give Danny some ice cream while we wait?
- Not at all.
- We don' t mind.
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?
Okay, you behave yourself.
What kind of ice cream do you like?
Chocolate.
Chocolate it shall be.
It' s amazing, all this activity today.
The guests and some staff left yesterday, but the...... last day' s always hectic.
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By 5: 00 tonight, you' il never know anybody was ever here.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
You know what I' m talking about, don' t you?
I can remember when I was a little boy...... my grandmother and I could hold conversations...... entirely without ever opening our mouths.
She called it "shining."
And for a long time I thought it was just the two of us...... that had "the shine" to us.
Just like you probably thought you was the only one.
But there are other folks...... though mostly they don' t know it, or don' t believe it.
How long have you been able to do it?
Why don' t you want to talk about it?
I' m not supposed to.
Who says you ain' t supposed to?
Tony.
Who' s Tony?
Tony' s the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that...... tells you things?
How does he tell you things?
It' s like I go to sleep, and he shows me things.
But when I wake up, I can' t remember everything.
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?
Do they know he tells you things?
Tony told me never to tell them.
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?
About the Overlook Hotel?
I don' t know.
Now think real hard, Doc.
Think.
Maybe he showed me something.
Scared of nothing here.
Some shine...... and some don' t.
Is there something bad here?
You know, Doc, when something happens...... it can leave a trace of itself behind.
Not things that anyone can notice.
Just like they can see things that haven' t happened yet...... sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago.
I think a lot of things happened right here...... in this particular hotel over the years.
And not all of them was good.
What about room 237?
Room 237?
You' re scared of room 237, ain' t you?
No, I ain' t.
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?
Nothing.
There ain' t nothing in room 237.
But you ain' t got no business going in there anyway.
So stay out.
You understand?
Good morning, hon.
Jesus.
I guess we' ve been staying up too late.
It' s really pretty outside.
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.
No good ones.
Something will come.
It' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.
That' s all it is.
I love it.
I really do.
I' ve never been this happy or comfortable anywhere.
It' s amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.
I tell you, when we first came up here...... l thought it was kind of scary.
I fell in love with it right away.
When I came up here for my interview...... it was as though I' d been here before.
I mean, we all have moments of deja vu...... but this was ridiculous.
The loser has to keep America clean.
How' s that?
- All right.
- And you' re going to lose.
And I' m going to get you.
You' d better run fast!
Look out!
I' m coming in close.
Loser has to keep America clean.
IKeep America clean.
Danny, you win.
Give me your hand.
Dead end.
Isn' t it beautiful?
It' s so pretty.
I didn' t think it was going to be this big.
And the search continues for that missing Aspen woman.
She disappeared on a hunting trip with her husband.
They may have to call off the search...... if a predicted snowstorm moves in tomorrow.
It' s incredible.
Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Fine.
Get a lot written today?
The weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight.
What do you want me to do about it?
Don' t be so grouchy.
I' m not...... being grouchy.
I just want to finish my work.
Okay.
I understand.
I' il come back later with a couple of sandwiches.
Maybe you' il let me read something then.
Wendy...... let me explain something to you.
When you come in and interrupt, you' re breaking my concentration.
You' re distracting me...... and it will then take me time to get back to where I was.
Fine.
We' re going to make a new rule:
Whenever I' m in here...... and you hear me typing...... or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...... when I' m in here, that means I am working.
That means don' t come in.
Now, do you think you can handle that?
Fine.
Why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
All right, you!
Don' t have!
No fair anymore.
I knew it.
This is IKDlK 1 2 calling IKDlK 1.
KDK 12 to KDK 1.
This is IKDlK 1.
We' re receiving you.
Over.
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.
Hi, how are you folks getting on up there?
Over.
We' re just fine.
But our telephones aren' t doing too well.
Are the lines down, by any chance?
Over.
Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm.
Over.
Any chance of them being repaired soon?
Well, I wouldn' t like to say.
Most winters they stay that way until spring.
Boy, this storm is really something, isn' t it?
Yes.
It' s one of the worst we' ve had for years.
Is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
I suppose not.
Over.
If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a call.
And, Mrs. Torrance?
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.
We' il do that.
It was real nice talking to you.
Bye.
Over and out.
Hello, Danny.
Come and play with us.
Come and play with us, Danny.
Forever...... and ever...... and ever.
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.
Please let me give you some money.
Really.
Well, I' m going to have some coffee.
Sure.
Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Daddy' s asleep.
I won' t make any noise.
He only went to bed a few hours ago.
I won' t make a sound.
All right.
Okay, Mom.
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
How' s it going, Doc?
I' m just a little bit tired.
Then why don' t you go to sleep?
I can' t.
I got too much to do.
Do you like this hotel?
I love it.
Don' t you?
I guess so.
Good.
I want you to like it here.
I wish we could stay here forever...... and ever...... and ever.
What?
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?
What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you?
That I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
You sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.
I love you more than anything else...... in the whole world...... and I would never do anything to hurt you...... never.
You know that, don' t you?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Mom, are you in there?
What happened?
Honey...... what' s wrong?
I had the most...... terrible nightmare I ever had.
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It' s okay, it' s okay now.
Really.
I dreamed that I...... that I killed you and Danny.
But I didn' t just kill you.
I cut you up into little pieces.
My God.
I must be losing my mind.
Everything' s going to be all right.
Come on.
Let' s get up off the floor.
There.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
Danny!
Everything' s okay!
Just go play in your room for a while.
Your dad' s just got a headache.
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.
Honey, let me just go get him out of here.
I' il be right back.
Why don' t you mind me?
Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
You did this to him...... didn' t you?!
You son of a bitch!
You did this to him!
Didn' t you?!
How could you?!
How could you?!
God!
I' d give anything for a drink.
I' d give my goddamn soul...... for just a glass of beer.
Hi, Lloyd.
A little slow tonight, isn' t it?
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.
What will it be?
I' m awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd...... because I just happen to have two twenties...... and two tens right here in my wallet.
I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.
So here' s what:
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...... a little glass and some ice.
You can do that, can' t you, Lloyd?
You' re not too busy, are you?
No, sir.
I' m not busy at all.
Good man.
You set them up...... and I' il knock them back, one by one.
White man' s burden, Lloyd, my man.
White man' s burden.
Say, Lloyd...... it seems I' m temporarily light.
How' s my credit in this joint, anyway?
Your credit' s fine, Mr. Torrance.
I like you, Lloyd.
You were always the best of them.
Best goddamned bartender...... from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.
I hope it' s nothing serious.
Just a little problem with...... the old sperm bank upstairs.
Thanks.
Can' t live with them...... can' t live without them.
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.
I didn' t.
I wouldn' t touch one hair on his goddamn little head.
I love the little son of a bitch.
Any fucking thing for him.
But that bitch!
As long as I live...... she' il never let me forget what happened.
I did hurt him once, okay?
It was an accident.
Completely unintentional.
It could have happened to anybody.
And it was three goddamn years ago!
The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor.
All I tried to do was pull him up.
A momentary loss of muscular coordination.
Thank God you' re here.
There' s someone else in the hotel with us.
There' s a crazy woman in one of the rooms.
She tried to strangle Danny.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
It' s the truth!
I swear it.
Danny told me.
He went up into one of the bedrooms.
The door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub.
She tried to strangle him!
Which room was it?
From Channel 10 in Miami...... this is Newswatch with Glen Rinker...... Ann Bishop, and the award- winning Newswatch team.
Good evening.
I' m Glen Rinker, Newswatch Ten.
As Miami continues to swelter in a record winter heat wave...... bringing temperatures to the 90s...... Central and Mountain states are buried in snow.
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow fell injust a few hours tonight.
Travel in the Rockies is almost impossible.
Airports are shut down, stranding thousands ofpassengers.
Railroad tracks are frozen.
Officials in Colorado tell Newswatch...... at least 3 have been killed by exposure to freezing winds.
The governor of Colorado is expected...... to declare a weather emergency.
The National Guard might be called out...... to clear streets and roads.
Weather forecasters predict more snow...... and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow...... with temperatures dropping well below zero.
Back here in Florida, we' ve got the opposite problem.
The heat and humidity are supposed to climb.
Local beaches should bejammed.
Our weather expert, Walter Cronice...... will have the local forecast later on Newswatch.
We' re sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
If you need assistance, please call the operator.
Yes, it' s me.
Thank God.
Did you find anything?
No.
Nothing at all.
I didn' t see one goddamn thing.
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?
Yes, I did.
And you didn' t see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing.
How is he?
He' s still asleep.
Good.
I' m sure he' il be himself again in the morning.
Are you sure it was the right room?
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.
He must have gone in that room.
The door was open, the lights were on.
I just don' t understand it.
What about those bruises on his neck?
Somebody did that to him.
I think...... he did it to himself.
No.
That' s not possible.
It wouldn' t be that different from the episode...... that he had before we came up here.
Would it?
Whatever the explanation is...
... l think we...... have to get Danny out of here.
Get him out of here?
You mean...... just leave the hotel?
It is so...... typical of you to create a problem like this...... when I finally have a chance to accomplish something!
When I' m really into my work!
I could really write my own ticket if I went back now, couldn' t l?
Shoveling out driveways, work in a car wash.
Any of that appeal to you?
I have let you fuck up my life so far...... but I am not going to let you fuck this up.
Good evening.
Forest Service.
My name is Dick Hallorann.
I' m the head chef at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening.
What can I do for you?
I' ve been trying to make an urgent phone call up there...... but the operator said that the phone lines are down.
A lot of lines around here are down due to the storm.
I hate to put you through any trouble...... but there' s a family up there all by themselves with a young kid.
And with this storm and everything...... l' d appreciate it if you' d give them a call on your radio...... just to see if everything' s okay.
I' il be glad to do that.
Why don' t you call me back in about 20 minutes?
Thank you very much.
I' il do that.
All right, sir.
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.
Good evening.
Hi, Lloyd.
Been away, but now I' m back.
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.
It' s good to see you.
It' s good to be back, Lloyd.
What' il it be, sir?
Hair of the dog that bit me.
Bourbon on the rocks.
That' il do her.
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.
No charge?
Your money' s no good here.
Orders from the house.
Orders from the house.
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.
I' m the kind of man likes to know who' s buying their drinks, Lloyd.
It' s not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance.
At least, not at this point.
Anything you say, Lloyd.
Anything you say.
Oh, dear!
I' m so sorry, sir.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
I' ve made an awful mess of your jacket, sir.
That' s all right.
I' ve got plenty of jackets.
I' m afraid it' s advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.
Advocaat, is it?
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...... is to come along to the gentlemen' s room...... and we' il get some water to it, sir.
Looks like you might have got a spot of it on yourself...... Jeevesy old boy.
That doesn' t matter, sir.
You' re the important one.
Awfully nice of you to say.
Of course, I intended to change my jacket this evening...... before the fish and goose soiree.
Very wise, sir.
Here.
I' il just...... hold this for you there, Jeevesy.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Let' s see if we can improve this with a little water, sir.
All right.
I' il just...... set my bourbon and advocaat down right there.
Won' t keep you a moment.
Fine.
What do they call you, Jeevesy?
Grady, sir.
Delbert Grady.
Grady?
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
That' s right, sir.
Mr. Grady...... haven' t I seen you somewhere before?
Why, no, sir.
I don' t believe so.
It' s coming off now, sir.
Mr. Grady...... weren' t you once the caretaker here?
Why, no, sir.
I don' t believe so.
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?
Yes, sir.
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.
And...... where are they now?
They' re somewhere around.
I' m not quite sure at the moment.
You were the caretaker here.
I recognize you.
I saw your picture in the newspapers.
You...... chopped your wife and daughter up into little bits.
And...... then you blew your brains out.
That' s strange, sir.
I don' t have any recollection of that at all.
Mr. Grady...... you were the caretaker here.
I' m sorry to differ with you, sir.
But you...... are the caretaker.
You' ve always been the caretaker.
I should know, sir.
I' ve always been here.
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...... that your son...... is attempting to bring an outside party...... into this situation?
Did you know that?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger?
A nigger...... cook.
How?
Your son...... has a very great talent.
I don' t think you are aware how great it is.
But he is attempting to use that very talent...... against your will.
Well...... he is a very willful boy.
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.
A very willful boy.
A rather...... naughty boy...... if I may be so bold, sir.
It' s his mother.
She...... interferes.
Perhaps they need a good...... talking- to.
Perhaps...... a bit more.
My girls, sir...... they didn' t care for the Overlook at first.
One of them actually stole a pack of matches...... and tried to burn it down.
But I...... corrected them, sir.
I could call the forest rangers first...... and...... tell them that we' re coming....... so that...... they could start searching for us in case we didn' t make it.

Bye.
What time will we get to Denver?
The snowplows are keeping things moving in town...... but the mountain roads are blocked.
Heavy snow throughout the Denver metro area.
We hear from the news department...... only a few flights are landing at Stapleton Airport...... and with storms like this...... l guess the entire airport will be closed within the hour.
Hon?
I' m just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes...... and I' il be right back.
All right.
I' il be back in just about five minutes.
How do you like it?
What are you doing down here?
I just...... wanted...... to talk to you.
Okay.
Let' s talk.
What do you want to talk about?
I can' t really remember.
You can' t remember.
No...... l can' t.
Maybe it was about Danny?
Maybe it was about him.
I think we should discuss Danny.
I think...... we should discuss what should be done with him.
What should be done with him?
I don' t know.
I don' t think that' s true.
I think you have some very definite ideas...... about what should be done with Danny.
And I' d like to know what they are.
Well, I...... l think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?
When do you think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible?
"As soon as possible?"
Please.
You believe his health might be at stake.
Yes.
And you are concerned about him.
And are you concerned about me?
Of course I am.
Of course you are!
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
What are you talking about?
Have you ever had a single moment' s...... thought about my responsibilities?
Have you ever thought for a single moment...... about my responsibilities to my employers?!
Has is ever occurred to you...... that I have agreed to look after the hotel until May 1 st?
Does it matter to you at all...... that the owners have placed their complete confidence in me...... and that I have signed a letter of agreement...... in which I' ve accepted that responsibility?
Do you have the slightest idea...... what a moral and ethical principal is?
Do you?!
Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future...... if I fail to live up to my responsibilities?
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!
Stay away from me!
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
Why?
Well...... l' m very confused.
And I just need a chance to think things over.
You' ve had your whole fucking life to think things over!
What good' s a few minutes more going to do you now?
Stay away from me!
Please!
Don' t hurt me.
I' m not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Light of my life.
I' m not going to hurt you.
You didn' t let me finish my sentence.
I said, "I' m not going to hurt you."
I' m just going to bash your brains in.
I' m going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!
I' m not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Please!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put that bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Give me the bat.
Please!
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.
Stop it!
Give me the bat.
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.
Please stop!
Give me the bat.
Stay away from me.
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.
Goddamn --!
What are you doing?
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Wait a minute!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
Goddamn it!
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!
Wendy, listen.
Let me out and I' il forget the whole goddamn thing.
It' il be just like nothing ever happened.
Baby.
I think you hurt my head real bad.
I' m dizzy.
I need a doctor.
Don' t leave me in here.
I' m going to go now.
I' m going to try...... to get Danny down the Sidewinder...... in the Snowcat today.
I' il bring back a doctor.
I' m going to go now.
You' ve got a big surprise coming to you.
You' re not going anywhere.
Go check out the Snowcat and the radio, and you' il see what I mean.
Go check it out.
Go check it out!
Go check it out.
It' s Grady, Mr. Torrance.
Delbert Grady.
Grady?
Hello, Grady.
Mr. Torrance...... l see you can hardly have taken care of the...... business we discussed.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.
I' il deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?
I wonder.
I have my doubts.
I, and others, have come to believe...... that your heart is not in this.
That you haven' t the belly for it.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.
That' s all I ask.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.
Somewhat more...... resourceful.
She seems to have got the better of you.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.
Only for the moment.
I fear you will have to deal with this matter...... in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.
I fear...... that is the only thing to do.
There' s nothing I look forward to...... with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
You give your word on that, do you, Mr. Torrance?
I give you my word.
Redrum.
Redrum.
Danny, stop it!
I' m home.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I can' t get out.
Run!
Run and hide!
Run!
Quick!
Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.
Not by the hair on your chinny- chin- chin?
Then I' il huff...... and I' il puff...... and I' il blow your house in!
Please!
Don' t!
Don' t!
Stop it!
Here' s Johnny!
Hello?
Anybody here?
Hello?
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Danny- boy!
I' m coming!
I' m coming, Dan!
Great party, isn' t it?
